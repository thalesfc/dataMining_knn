1 review- peter jackson the frighten has receiv some notic for set the record for most comput effect ever in a movi , and still come in at the extrem cheap $30 million price tag . but for those who were dismay by this year blockbust like twister and independ day , the frighten has much more to offer than special effect . and for those worri wether or not peter jackson would compromis to hollywood you can rest easili . the frighten is as far remov from hollywood as a high-profil movi can get . michael j . fox star as frank bannist , a con artist who can speak to ghost . he use this abil to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddi scare the hell out of peopl , then he come and pretend to get rid of them . this is how he has made a live ever sinc his wife die in a car crash 5 year ago . frank latest custom are a young coupl , play by trini alvarado and peter dobson . when dobson end up dead , alvarado start to take an interest in fox . but dobson spirit is still around as he refus to beleiv he dead . this lead to a veri awkward and amus dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tag along as a ghost . thing start get complic for fox when he is accus for a seri of murder take place in the town . fox see someon name the soul collector crush the heart of the victim , but noon els can see that . so when fox show up to tri and save each victim , natur peopl suspect he is the killer . fox see that alvarado is next on the soul collector hit list , and the last half hour of the movi deal with fox attempt to save her from this evil spirit . there are mani wonder twist and turn in the screenplay written by peter jackson and franc walsh . the movi start off as a black comedi , and end up a horror-act film . the mix between these genr are perfect . no laugh are sacrif in the name of horror , and vice versa . one point of content might be a lacklust score by danni elfman . but that hard seem like a flaw when you have such a divers cast all in top form . michael j . fox deliv one of his best perform to date as a man who hide the sorrow of his wife death , and then is forc to confront this later on . alvarado , look like andi macdowel , make a great frighten , tough , and smart heroin . and jefferi comb , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliant bizaar . the frighten never onc feel like it is run long . the first hour is as funni as ani comedi this year , and the last half hour is as thrill as ani of the big budget blockbust . this movi is probabl what casper would'v look like if david lynch direct it . it easili the best film of the year , so far .
1 " no man is an island , " one charact quot john donn in apt pupil , effect summar the movi theme . while hard a great film , singer ambiti adapt of king short stori * is challeng nonetheless ; perhap the most shock aspect of this inclement psycholog thriller is that a major studio got behind it . apt pupil is a bleak pictur destin to be misunderstood by the mass . 1984 . wonder-br high school honour student todd bowden ( renfro ) conduct his own extracurricular investig of kurt dussand , a nazi war crimin who fear fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . bowden suspect arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lone german senior citizen who live nearbi , is actual a pseudonym dussander-much research and dust for fingerprint prove young todd theori . bowden strike a deal with dussand : in exchang for not reveal his ident , dussand must satisfi bowden intens curios by recount the atroc of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . the stori he hear keep todd up at night and haunt his daydream , but like a bystand at a traffic accid , todd desir for gori detail overrid his repuls . bowden reviv in dussand feel dormant sinc the end of wwii . march in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholli cathart for dussand : it lead to his tortur of a cat and the torment of his " student " , among other thing . bowden , who has taken on veri hate qualiti ( he kill bird and doodl swastika on his notebook ) , engag the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . dussand stand to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondari school futur . all of this wind down to a fair unpredict ( and unsettl ) conclus , one which requir leap of faith from it audienc yet is more satisfi than the sourc materi excess climax . singer has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . his the usual suspect and apt pupil are both about evil masquerad as innoc ( verbal tic and todd golden-boy reput are plausibl ruse ) ; they showcas moral bankrupt anti-hero to whom tell the truth is not an option if they are to achiev their goal . apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspect , a movi famous and popular part becaus it plot machin were not german to the outcome-ther was no way you could see the end come , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . thank , singer has gotten most of the usual suspect film-schoolish geek theatric out of his system . some scene in apt pupil feel overdirect and/or obvious ( the dream sequenc were extran ) , but the major of the film is subdued-and singer handl of the violent scene is bold restrain for a film about a murder and a murderer-in-train . mckellan and renfro perform contribut enorm to the overal success of the film ; while most peopl will focus on british stage vet mckellan finely-tun realiz , i'd like to singl out renfro dare work . he isn't afraid to play someon larg unapp and cold-heart ; he strip his charact of vaniti , someth mani of his peer wouldn't do . ( can you pictur kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thoma in the same role ? ) renfro was recent charg with possess of cocaine-i hope he doesn't continu down that path , becaus he has a big futur in good movi wait for him . as guidanc counsellor edward french , " friend " schwimmer also deserv mention . he want to be the parent to todd that todd own well-to-do folk are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-ha mom and dad wrap around his pinki finger ) , and his sincer make the apt pupil blackening-heart even more appar . but one of the film ultim question , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answer in french , whose motiv are the slightest bit ambigu . no man is an island , indeed-w all have the capac to make the " right " or the " wrong " choic . schwimmer win play one of a trio of fascin charact who make the unconvent apt pupil laudibl . -octob , 1998 * the excel collect king stori call differ season spawn not onli apt pupil , but the shawshank redempt ( origin titl rita hayworth and the shawshank redempt ) and stand by me ( origin titl the bodi ) .

1 what i look for in a movi is not necessarili perfect . sometim a movi has such strong idea that despit whatev flaw it may have , i will prefer it to a better-mad film that is not as thought-provok . the thin red line is flaw but it provok . terenc malick return to filmmak 20 year after day of heaven and produc this medit look at war . unlik this year save privat ryan , which dwell on war as a necessari evil and explor the moral ambigu thereof , the thin red line simpli say war is wast . while that might seem obvious to some , onli after experienc the film do you realiz how profound a wast it is . save privat ryan has an under and practic accept that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line say idealist avoid this at all cost . one messag is not necessarili more correct than the other . it just depend on one point of view . in malick film , war is set in a tropic paradis , and john toll cinematographi is beyond lush . the set pose the question , whi are we fight in the face of such beauti ? in save privat ryan , the captur of a german soldier present the moral quandari of whether to let him go . in the thin red line , the japanes present the moral quandari of war in the first place . they are just like the american -- frighten and angri , griev and pray . all that separ them is war . the flaw in the thin red line come in the voice-ov . unbeliev as come from the charact and sometim pretenti , sometim corni , the voice-ov tell us what the imag befor us alreadi do and are complet unnecessari . dispens with them , malick could have achiev a tarkovskian grandeur . instead , he get distract self-consci . asid from that , malick direct is stun . the track shot across windswept hill and around transport speed toward shore are extraordinari . sean penn , elia kotea , and nick nolt give the best perform . penn is subtl as a sergeant tri to hide his human , kotea is genuin as a compassion captain , and nolt startl as a colonel whose blood vessel are about to burst if he cannot win his battl . john travolta and georg clooney are the worst in cameo role . ultim howev , the thin red line interest is not in the charact and it is not in drama . it has been frequent critic for it lack of dramat structur , but malick clear has differ thing on his mind . has no one ever thought that get dramat entertain from war is exploit ? what malick is work with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provok .
0 vega vacat is the fourth film star chevi chase and bever d'angelo as the head of the hapless griswold famili . as with the other three film , their two children , rusti and audrey , are play by a revolv seri of actor . this time ethan embri and marisol nichol fill the role . also back , is cousin eddi ( randi quaid ) , the slob relat who seem to bring problem wherev he goe . in vega vacat clark griswold ( chase ) decid to take the famili on vacat to las vega so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wed vow . it is at this point when comedi is suppos to ensu . appar the filmmak thought that put the griswold into las vega would be so funni on it own that they wouldn't bother to write ani joke into the script . at least that the way it look when watch this turkey . about half way through vega vacat i began to have serious doubt as to whether there would actual be a singl laugh in the entir film , sinc there had been none up to that point . by the end of the movi i had actual snicker a coupl of time , and i had smile at a coupl of gag . i might add that none of the funni ( and i use the term loos ) moment came as a result of anyth chase , d'angelo or quaid were involv in . they might as well have stay home for as much as they contribut to this film . the two best thing in this movi were ethan embri and marisol nichol as the griswold kid , who manag to have a coupl of their own adventur . rusti becom a vega high roller , provid most of the film best moment . everi time chase and quaid were involv in a gag , it just made it more and more appar that they should have stop this seri after the third film . which bring me to the best moment of the film . the griswold are drive down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the origin vacat ) begin to play . christi brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movi ) drive by . it was a cute moment , but all it realli did was remind me just how funni the first film had been , and just how far that this seri has fallen . too bad .
0 star kiefer sutherland ; rees witherspoon & bokeem woodbin i use to think that the convers was the wors film i had ever seen . freeway is give me second thought . freeway is a modern retel of littl red ride hood . onli in the nineti , littl red ride hood is a foul-mouth juvenil delinqu play by rees witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) . to top that pathet premis off -- rees goe to visit granni and you'll never guess who wait under the cover in granni bed . keifer sutherland is one of hollywood most talent , yet underr actor , and rees witherspoon is except talent and will most like becom a major star . so what are they do in this movi ? after see the end result , undoubt they are both ask themselv the same question . you might be ask yourself whi this is such a short review . the answer is quit simpl -- i dont want to wast ani more of my time write or think about this movi than absolut necessari . i wast enough of my time just sit through it . note to keifer : you wonder whi you aren't a bigger star in hollywood ? becaus you keep make movi like this . note to rees : you were great in fear , what happen this time ? note to both : don't worri about it too much , no one saw this movi anyway . bottom line -- i'm still shake my head . don't wast your time on this turkey . if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movi , go rent flatlin or young gun . rees witherspoon abund act talent are use to their full potenti in fear , a great thriller . do yourself a favor and rent one of these movi -- but stay as far away from freeway as you possibl can .
0 " it was not scari . " these are the first word that came to mind after it was over . when a movi is call _vampires_ , " not scari " aren't word that should be associ with it . but that wasn't my onli gripe . john carpent is a name associ with cutting-edg cinema , as in the intens scare of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the princ of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escap from new york_ . unfortun , the onli thing that is cut edg about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movi is abl to reach . with an anem plot and not-quite-kosh special effect , _john carpent vampires_ has bare enough substanc to slake the thirst of even the least discern genr fan . the film is at first concern with a group of roam vampir slayer , led by jame wood , of all peopl . like some sort of holi a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invad and wipe out a nest of vampir in a new mexico shack . their method is amus innov : the blood-suck are reel out with harpoon so they can flare up in the sun like matchstick . to commemor their victori , the loutish band decor a motel room with hooker and parti the night away . their celebr is short-liv , howev , as a master vampir name valek ambush and single-hand destroy most of the team . wood jack crow and buddi montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escap with their live , along with a woman name katrina ( sheryl lee ) . although the woman has been bitten , montoya and crow decid to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampir . the rest of the movi is concern with the boy hunt for valek ( thoma ian griffith ) , a freaki marilyn manson-typ who on a mission that date back 600 year . along the way they pick up a priest name guiteau ( tim guine ) , a charact who serv pretti much the same purpos as the jitteri cpl . upham in _save privat ryan_ . some stuff happen in the middl of the movi , but i can't rememb most of it , becaus i often found a twitch hair in the corner of the frame more interest than what was happen on screen . _vampires_ final start to pick up about 90 minut into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandon prison-turn vampir nest . onli then doe the film begin to even resembl a carpent flick . but it too littl too late . we get the inevit final confront , but it seem tack on and rather anti-climact ( come on , we'r deal with _the_ master vampir here ! ) interest , last summer vampir action _blade_ was deriv from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seem more steep in campi cheesi than the former , a more deliber superhero flick . wood jack crow spout glib off-the-cuff one-lin and stroll away from explod build with that oh-so-cool stride . and his motiv for kill vampir ? take a wild guess . ( hint : a ______ kill his _____ when he was just a _____ . ) at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylish . _vampires_ lack even cheap thrill to mask it gossamer-thin plot . to make up for this , the movi resort to other " shock , " such as it general condescend attitud toward women ( crow slap them around for the fun of it ) and an overplay contempt for religion ( crow teas guiteau incess about whether his vow of celibaci has made him prone to " get woodi . " ) it can be argu that mayb i want too much from this movi . if not scari and gori , i want tens , relentless , and exhaust . _john carpent vampires_ is none of these . i can onli recommend it for the hardcor carpent fan . for the rest of you look for a good scare , bewar : _vampires_ is a film with no teeth .
0 don't get me wrong -- i tend to appreci besson naiv , unasham romant worldview , an artsi european sensibl gone thorough hollywood . his 1994 leon is excit and absurd move , thank main to the interplay between jean reno and a young natali portman , and 1997 the fifth element is a goofi paean to love , l-u-v , that even more of a hoot on repeat view . but his joan of arc is a mess , despit some stir battl scene and the most knockout presenc of a close-crop milla jovovich as the maiden herself . jovovich , besson own person muse through the make of his last two film ( though they'v sinc separ ) , is magnet and energet enough to play a credibl joan ( as long as you believ joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabul , supermodel-level babe ) . and besson remain a servic action film director , though not an especi facil one . lead her armi against the seem impenetr fortress of the english , joan struggl against great odd is undeni stir , and besson help you understand how the french could believ , fervent , that god is on her side . besson big mistak , i think , is tri to dramat the interior life of his subject . yes , joan had vision -- but i guarante that whatev imag a sympathet audienc conjur in it collect mind will be more compel than the blue-ey christ figur on display in besson hallucinatori dream sequenc . the whole conceit turn into a disast right about the time dustin hoffman ( bill as " the conscienc " ) show up , spout platitud and send poor milla run around her cell , babbl like alli mcbeal . that kind of a shame , sinc she doe quit well up to that point , charg into battl with a banshe wail that suggest the erupt of a sublim bloodthirsti . that dark attract aspect of her charact -- that she as like a charismat madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betray by the final reel , in which the conscienc browbeat her over the kill she overseen and joan start to look like littl more than a veri confus young ladi who about to take a fall . as the stori wind down , with joan condemn to a horribl death by fire , besson is aim for tragedi and psycholog signific . troubl is , he chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balanc of the pictur -- includ some blith cgi bloodsh in the battl scene -- and it imposs to shake the feel that this particular vision of the middl age is , to a great extent , noth more than a put-on . this glib , pre-fab version of such a great stori make me all the more grate for dreyer the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogu is drawn from the actual transcript of joan trial , and which stand as one of the most harrow experi in all of cinema . compar to that film , the messeng play as a crime against histori . -------------------------------------------------------------- direct by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematographi by thierri arbogast music by eric serra star milla jovovich france/usa , 1999 theatric aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 --------------------------------------------------------------
1 the start of this movi remind me of part from the movi stargat . peopl are look around in an egyptian templ read about some danger thing that is go to destroy earth in the futur . after a sort of confus bit involv fake-look cyborg thing , the movi jump into the futur and the movi improv by leap and bound . the basic idea behind the movi is that everi onc in a while ( make that everi 1000 year or so ) an evil forc come to destroy earth . the thing need to defend against this menac are the four element of natur plus the fifth element . the plot in this movi realli isn't that import to the thing though . this movi has veri good special effect , for the most part . the techno-ish music in the background fit the mood veri well . bruce willi is an illeg taxi-cab driver in a futurist new york citi . one day a ladi drape with a few bandag drop down into his trunk . this movi is about what happen . the plot twist are interest and the movi never fail to present the viewer with a varieti of differ locat . also there is a fair bit of action in the film , particular toward the end . some charact are just plain strang includ a highly-energet deejay in drag . bruce willi doe his normal job of blow thing away like he alway doe . the movi is definit watchabl and rare slow down . it is one of those sci-fi film where you'll be say " cool " follow by a " what the hell ? ! ? ! " . i give the fifth element .

1 for more than a decad , anjelica huston has been one of america finest actress . in her directori debut , bastard out of carolina , base upon dorothi allison larg autobiograph book on child abus and poverti in the south , huston display impress profici behind the camera as well . the film tell the stori of ruth ann boatwright , nicknam bone by one of her uncl at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina . through voice-ov ( narrat done by laura dern ) , we find that she near didn't surviv birth , as her singl mother anney , play by jennif jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield dure an automobil accid . that just the begin of her troubl . bone is deem illegitim on her birth certif , a social stigma which her mother and her larg poor famili obsess over for year to come . anney meet and wed lyle , a kind man and good stepfath whom give bone a babi sister befor die in an automobil accid . anney brother earl , play by michael rooker , introduc her to glen , play by ron eldard , a co-work at the mill . glen , the black sheep of a wealthi famili ( " when are you gonna make your daddi proud ? i'll tell you when - never ! " he told ) and fill with bitter , court anney and eventu win her , despit warn of a violent temper . when anney miscarri with his much-priz babi boy , glen lose his capabl to supress his violent outburst and begin to direct them at bone , beat and abus her , while the love-depend anney tri to turn a blind eye and justifi his behaviour . thing turn for the wors when glen lose his job and the famili of four sink into impoverish . while set sever decad ago , this stori remain complet relev in today societi , where abus wive return to their husband , and abus commit against children by one spous is routin overlook by the other . the real star of this domest drama is not top-bil jennif jason leigh , but child actress jena malon , who play bone in a wrench and wholli impress debut perform . her work is of award-calibr , and in this age in which a preponder of superb child perform have emerg ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natali portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malon perform stand up well . leigh perform in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she not realli given much to do , and ron eldard work is veri solid , skill manouv his charact mood in and out of explos rage . one can alway sens that underneath his glen is a pressure-cook tick away . of the support cast , special note must be made of the crimin underr michael rooker perform . there a bit too much generic formula in the screenplay for my tast , from the various charact spout off countri bumpkin , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granni ( play by grace zabriski ) sit on the porch rock chair , to impass soliloqui better suit for a stage perform . still , it cannot be deni that ann meredith screenplay contain a wallop of emot power . huston direct of the film is surehand and impress , give the film good pace and elicit good perform from her cast , particular the young malon . her sequenc of child abus are shot in a hard-hit emot , rather than graphic , manner , and are veri effect . huston talent with camera posit is wonder , from a visual strike shot done through a fan , to an extend sequenc in the front seat of an automobil . the film has the toned-down feel of a televis product ; bastard out of carolina was origin compos and cut for broadcast on the tnt cabl station , who end up declin the film due to sentiment that scene of abus and rape in the film were too disturb realist for their audienc . perhap some sequenc of the film may be unpleas , but as a whole bastard out of carolina add up to a power viewer experi worth see .
1 perhap the most dramat chang in the motion pictur industri in this decad have to do with special effect . there is no question that action-adventur and science-fiction/act movi are now judg by the charact of their light and nois . wherea classic adventur pic of the last twenti year , such as raider of the lost ark , were made in grand tradit fashion ; contemporari film like jurass park are multimillion-dollar creation of comput technolog . the latest in this visual awesom seri of movi , the wachowski brother the matrix , is a testament to the skill use of special effect and it abil to enhanc a movi stori . unlik mani sci-fi movi which promot themselv as effects-heavi blockbust but fail to deliv on that promis , the matrix is a care construct special effect event . it run 135 minut in length and employ a countless number of computer trick which rang from gimmick to grandios , and the qualiti of the effect remain constant throughout the film length . contrari to popular trend , the matrix commit itself to be a spectacl of light and sound . in this regard , the movi is someth like a card sharp . with it flashi mass strip away , the matrix would be quit shallow and untal . the script is characterist weak , and the dialogu suffer in lieu of a far more innov visual approach . but , like the card sharp , the matrix wow it audienc to such a high degre that actual content is irrelev . the viewer don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effect sequenc is right around the corner . and right around the corner they usual are , for the script tell a fast-pac , albeit frequent revisit stori . as the movi explain , the world as we know it is noth but an elabor comput program construct by an artifici intellig for the purpos of placat mankind . billion of human be lie in this dormant state while the intellig -- the matrix -- " farm " our life energi . onli a select group of individu know of the " real " world , and a particular ingeni squad of these rebel is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurenc fishburn ) . morpheus and his crew recruit a comput expert name neo ( keanu reev ) , believ he is a prophesi individu who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peac to earth . the cast play out this stori in stylish fashion . the set design is veri dynam , run the gambit between cramp and dreari to bright and airi . the costum , as well as the actor who wear them , add to the role . for instanc , the manifest antagonist in the movi , a group of " agent " creat by the matrix in it comput program , all dress in match secret servicewear ; the rebel fighter , on the other hand , dress in rich hue of leather . the cast cannot be critic , for the typic stoic reev isn't requir to say much and laurenc fishburn get plenti of time to be so damn cool . support in carrie-ann moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weav are all effectu . one of the best comparison to thw matrix is last year scienc fiction masterpiec dark citi , particular if one ponder how this same premis would'v work from a differ approach . the alex proya film was far more dark and introspect , requir a bit of thought befor theme becam clear ; here , the wachowski brother have manag to construct a thrill-rid motion pictur with littl abandon and much nois . the better pictur between the two depend on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the nois did not get in the way of the fun .
0 the " disney stick-to-what-you-do-best " rule state that disney anim featur will invari be sublim but whenev they tri their hand at live-act kid entertain , they will fail miser . this goe doubl for occas when they tri to make a live-act adapt of a popular cartoon ( rememb the 1996 version of 101 dalmat ? i'm still tri to forget ) . that rule prove more depend than ever with inspector gadget , an insult , despic and , worst of all , expens piec of trash tri to pass itself off as a viabl children film . it will bore anyon over five and should prove unbear for adult , even at it relat skinni run time of 80 minut . it film like this that make me want to go to my local blockbust and rent someth from the day when brain were more import than budget and wit compens for lack of fanci effect . just as matthew broderick began to convinc me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career take a nosed to hell with his " role " as john brown , a depress secur guard with a big heart who hope that one day he can becom a real policemen and help the peopl around him . he dream of heroic deed and the subsequ admir of his long time crush , dr . brenda bradford ( joeli fisher ) . but after a few bizarr coincid it seem that he has to dream no longer . john break everi bone in his bodi while tri to save dr . brenda father . dr . brenda has been work on a " gadget project , " which would make a half-man half-machin super-policeman to fight crime . feel indebt to john she decid to save his life by make him the subject , realiz his dream of becom a policeman . now , when he say " go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here] " he can use all kind of nifti gadget to captur crook , bang up bandit and mangl murder . in the meantim , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man respons for the murder of the good doctor father is build a gadget of his own : a carbon copi of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown worst nemesi . claw has plan of world domin , which leav it up to the inspector and his gadget mobil ( voic of d . l . hughley ) to save human from his wrath . state of the art effect fli at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movi and yet director david kelogg never set up a convinc atmospher . had they replac all the fanci gizmo with dollar bill they would have wound up with the same effect . what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredi of a meal : all of the expens f/x amount to noth . part of the charm of the tv seri was it sli irrever which has gone down the toilet in the condescend movi . can kid realli admir a hero so goody-two-sho that he scream " hey ! you ran a stop sign ! " while hang off the back bumper of a quick move vehicl ? i think that today children will respond better to somebodi dash , someon ultra-cool . they ( probabl ) receiv enough preach from their parent and it an insult to their intellig to assum that they want to go to an action movi to see a father figur kick butt . in addit to the more complex complaint abov , there also the simpl stuff : inspector gadget is bore , formula and ach implaus . there no feel that the director realli care about his stori : more than ani other film i'v seen this year , this one realli feel like it was made on an assembl line . there a popular commerci ( for sprite , but that irrelev ) run in movi theater befor featur that spoof the way major studio deal with project . it consist of studio suit discuss a fictiti ( thank god ) movi call " death slug " . each execut gleefulli present a differ merchandis tie-in ( slug taco ! slug on a stick ! ) . at the end one of them ask " what about the movi ? " anoth answer : " well , we don't have a script yet , but we can bang one out by friday .

" ---agent swanbeck ( sir anthoni hopkin ) , the seri new agent phelp , take ethan hunt ( tom cruis ) down a notch . a russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has creat a new virus ( and it antidot ) call chimera that destroy it host within twenti hour of inject . a rogu imf agent , sean ambros ( dougray scott ) , want to use the diseas and cure to blackmail a pharmaceut compani into sell him enough stock to make him owner of the compani ( he know it will soon be worth it weight in gold thank to the outbreak of the virus he is go to caus ) . pose as ethan hunt , ambros gain the confid of the scientist long enough to get onli the cure , not realiz that the scientist had inject himself with the virus to prevent exact what ambros was tri to do . the real ethan hunt is call in from his vacat to persuad beauti thief nyah nordoff-hal ( thandi newton ) to assist the imf team in retriev the stolen good . ethan and nyah fall quick in love , but ethan soon find himself in a real dilemma when he learn that his new love has onli been hire becaus she was a former lover of ambros . reluct , he set up nyah to be rescu from prison by ambros so she can infiltr his compound and send back intellig to the team . ethan must race against time to keep ambros from obtain and spread the virus and prevent ani harm from come to nyah . although the first mission : imposs film was a moder box offic success , audienc pan it becaus they felt the plot was too confus and there wasn't much action ( although be a fan of the seri both old and new , i thought the movi was pretti decent and especi gutsi to make phelp a bad guy ) . that problem has been rectifi in the sequel by make the plot more access ( courtesi of one of the writer of the previous entri , robert town ) and by turn the film into one gigant action set piec under the steadi hand of action film guru john woo . the end result is one of the most entertain ( yet simpl ) action film made in a long while . unfortun , the first forti minut or so are relat slow , dwell main on ethan and nyah quick blossom romanc and seem more in place in a jame bond film than with the less glamor mission : imposs tv seri . ethan conflict is a compel one , but it seem veri rush ( and come about becaus of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself caus ! ) . john woo handl all of this with an artist flair that seem out of place , featur a great deal of slow fade and dramat frame close-up . the surreal natur of these sequenc are distract and ultim a detriment to the film . thank though , at the point ambros discov nyah decept , mission : imposs ii becom veri entertain and action-pack . robert town screenplay take some of the convent set up in the first film and parodi them dure a sequenc where ethan must break into a high-ris build and retriev the remain specimen of the virus . after that , the action scene just begin to build in intens , as is the case with mani of woo previous high-octan film . the final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruin by the trailer , unfortun ) . as far as summer entertain goe , mission : imposs ii is servic fare . anyon look for hardcor action won't be disappoint ( except for dure the first half of the film , perhap ) . even if you weren't a fan of the first film , this entri deserv some check out .

1 when i initi set out to review this film , my tag line was go to be " you too can believ whale can fli " . then it was go to be " you too can believ pastel triangl can fli " . then , it was go to be " you too can believ wood sprite can fli " . final , i just gave up tri to come up with a tag line and decid to say . . . there a lot of fli go on in this film ! as our first host steve martin tell us , the origin concept behind fantasia was to bring it out everi year with some old segment retain and some new segment ad in . well appar that plan fell by the waysid for a while , becaus approxim sixti year have pass sinc the origin classic was releas . part of this might have someth to do with the cold recept the film got when it was first releas in 1940 ( gross somewher close to $110 , 000 in it origin month of releas ) . subsequ re-releas of the film have elev the popular of the film to the classic status it has final achiev ( and right deserv ) . to celebr the releas of an updat version of fantasia , disney and imax team up to present the anim film in a fashion no one had seen befor : six stori high . in an exclus four month engag ( from januari 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at mani imax theater across the us . after the engag is over , the film will be shown at regular theater . is the format effect for the film ? with a few except , yes . the first segment we are present with is set to beethoven fifth symphoni . it hard to describ exact what this segment is about , but it involv a bunch of bright color butterfli look triangl flit about happili . everyth seem to be go great for these littl thing until the ground erupt with swarm of evil , black bat-lik triangl that attack and engulf their lighter counterpart . eventu , shaft of light from abov help drive away the evil bat-lik thing and peac return to the butterfli thing . though this segment isn't veri stori driven , some of the imag are veri visual strong , especi the scene in which the dark cloud of bat thing ( who are all outlin in blood red color ) begin to overtak the sky . the next segment is set to ottorino respighi " the pine of rome " . in this segment , some humpback whale swim happili through the ocean and eventu emerg from the water and fli around the massiv iceberg that pepper the oceanscap . a whale calf get into a scuffl with some nearbi bird dure the flight and end up get trap in a giant iceberg he smash into while tri to avoid the bird attack . he is final save ( by anoth liber shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the sky and fli into the upper atmospher where they frolic in the " ocean " of cloud . again , visual are the key with this segment , especi where the whale are involv . report the whale , as view on an imax screen in certain sequenc , are shown as actual size . the cgi whale look incred life-lik , except for some goog cartoon eye drawn onto the imag . one especi strike imag involv the giant shadow of one of the whale be cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tri to find a way out to it parent . absolut beauti stuff . the third segment ( and the least of the eight segment ) is set to georg gershwin " rhapsodi in blue " . this segment is design as a tribut to acclaim caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwin four differ stori about sad soul live in depress era new york . there a construct worker who dream of be a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dream of have a job , a young girl that dream of spend time with her parent instead of be hustl off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dream of be free from his overbear wife . i won't go into how everyth work out , but in fine disney tradit there is a happi end . unfortun , the stori drag quit a bit and the seem out of place within the hyper realiti of the rest of the segment . segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich " piano concerto no . 2 " and is an anim version of han christian andersen " the steadfast tin soldier " . a one leg toy tin soldier fall in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assum is also one leg becaus he can't see her other leg extend out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . the jester knock the soldier out of a window and continu pursu the ballerina . littl doe the jester know , the soldier has been deposit in the sewer and has journey through the pipelin onli to be swallow by a fish that has been captur and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldier that the one leg one come from . the soldier eventu save the day and get the girl . although the end has been alter from the andersen stori , " the steadfast tin soldier " is decent told with in the framework of a seven minut short . some children may find the jester to be a littl frighten , but otherwis the segment is well made . segment five is the funniest of the bunch . set to camill saint-saen " the carniv of the anim " , this segment featur a flamingo tortur his fellow flamingo with a yo-yo while they are tri to perform a choreograph danc number . while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the allig and hippo danc in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplish and a welcom bit of comedi . segment six is the onli segment to be repeat from the origin 1940 fantasia , and it the one that peopl rememb most , " the sorcer apprentic " . the stori is the most recogniz , so the draw here is see it on the enorm imax screen in remast stereo . unfortun , the segment wasn't made to be present on larg format film ( consid it was shot full frame ) and exhibit larg amount of grain . there were at least two occas where imag were veri hard to make out due to the excess grain . similar problem crop up on modern day releas when project on screen too larg for the imag to be shown accur ( but no one seem to notic for some strang reason ) , an anomali common to mani 18-plus screen theater . segment seven is set to sir edward elgar " pomp and circumst march no . 1 " and is the onli other fantasia segment to featur a stock disney charact . donald duck " star " as an assist to noah , whose task is load all of the anim onto the ark . dure the load , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believ that the other one didn't make it on the boat . they are constant miss each other due to comic misadventur main involv donald be crush by anim in various manner . despit the slapstick style of comedi in this piec , it display more emot in it final scene than mani of the tear-jerk foist on audienc these day . power stuff . segment eight bring a whole new mean to the clich ? " save the best for last " . set to igor stravinski " the firebird " , an elk awaken a forest sprite that proceed to chang the winteri landscap into a beauti springtim landscap . tree bloom and flower blossom and everyth seem to be go well until the sprite becom inquisit about a larg mountain hous a strang format . when the sprite examin the format , it awaken and becom the titular firebird . in a stun spectacl , the firebird rear back and unleash and fire storm that destroy everyth in it path , includ everyth that the sprite has work to creat . some amaz anim is present here , and well worth the ten dollar a ticket alon ( although brush stroke are evid in one scene due to the enlarg of the film ) . the host segment are larg ( no pun intend ) throwaway , although steve martin clip is pretti funni . be sure to stay through the credit for a littl more humor from martin . penn and teller are usual funni , but here their gag seem routin and therefor uninterest . the best segment come from , of all peopl , bett midler , who get to tell us about some of the abandon segment that never made it off of the draw board . piec like flight of the bumblebe , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner " ride of the valkyri " , and a strang segment prepar in the 40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all preview here and teas that they may appear in futur instal . for fan of visual stimul or classic music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . the film is also decent famili entertain and contain littl to no objection materi . as i mention earlier in the review , if ten dollar seem like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not becaus after it run in imax theater it is go to be brought out in regular theater . i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . then you too can believ that whales/triangl things/sprit can fli .

0 in 1989 , director edward zwick began his career with the power civil war drama , " glori , " but sinc then , he has made continu disappoint , to me at least , with 1994 " legend of the fall , " and 1996 " courag under fire . " those two film weren't bad , just not veri good , but with zwick latest film , " the sieg , " he has final made one . " the sieg , " is a modern-day action-thril that focus on terror that is sweep through new york citi . investig the matter is fbi agent anthoni hubbard ( denzel washington ) and frank haddad ( toni shalhoub ) , who are first hit by the ordeal when a citi bus explod with sever innoc peopl on it . later , a bomb goe off in a broadway theater , kill even more . they soon meet cia oper elis kraft ( annett bene ) , who may veri well hold the key to the ident of the arab terrorist . there are some movi that simpli don't need to be made , and , " the sieg " may veri well be one of them . oh , sure , zwick think he is make a " meaning " action film , sinc he has ad lot of exposit scene in which the audienc is basic lectur on the horror of terror , but what he realli has made is actual no more substanti than , say , " die hard , " which also star bruce willi . this time , willi is horribl wast as a general of the u . s . armi , who put a state of martial law over nyc dure the climax . whatev point , " the sieg , " earnest tri to make , were obvious lost in the translat from page to screen , or mayb , zwick never realli had anyth serious to say in the first place . the role of the arab communiti is offens stereotyp , just as women were in the recent , " john caprent vampir , " by place them all in the categori of " bad guy . " " the sieg , " contain three fine actors---washington , bene , and shalhoub---but washington is stuck with a charact that contain not an ounc of even remot develop . bene has slight more to do , and has an intrigu charact to work with , while shalhoub pretti much steal the show , even though , again , he has no real charact . by the climax of , " the sieg , " with washington give a sermon to willi on the so-cal " messag " of the stori , i felt like i had wander into a sequel to , " on dead ground , " in which steven seagal gave a 10-minut speech at the end about preserv the environ . " the sieg " is constant heavy-hand , not entertain or insight , and just goe to prove that not even the best actor can save a film that lack a satisfactori screenplay .

1 everi onc in a while , when an except famili film come along , i will attempt to champion it by challeng parent to put their money where their mouth have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of film suitabl for children , it is remark how mani non-disney film disappear in a coupl of week . now i see that in so do , i have unfair ghettoiz these film . so i am issu my challeng not just to parent , but to anyon who want to support smart , funni , energet film-mak : see matilda . see it in a theater , rather than shrug and wait for it on video . see the best film i have seen in 1996 . not the best children film . . . the best film . period . base on a stori by roald dahl , it tell of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarili bright girl whose great misfortun it is to have a pair of deepli stupid parent : harri ( danni devito ) , a crook use car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-mind bingo addict . the wormwood bare notic matilda exist , and when they do , it is onli to scold her for spend too much time read book . when they final do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hat miss agatha trunchbul ( pam ferri ) . but thing begin to look up for matilda when she discov a sympathet teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtur her natur inquisit . matilda also discov anoth special talent -- the abil to move thing with her mind -- which allow her to help herself and miss honey to overcom miss trunchbul cruelti . it was this spring jame and the giant peach which inspir me to note that the best and most last tale for children tend to have more than a hint of dark to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl respons for the gleeful ghoulish of jame and willi wonka and the chocol factori has more of the same in store with matilda . and just as jame benefit from the dark sensibl of henri selick and tim burton , matilda soar on the cock-ey direct of danni devito . devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the rose , and he contribut some memor imag . in one scene , an unfortun girl is made an exampl of by miss trunchbul when she is pick up by her pig-tail and flung through the air like a throw hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forc to eat an entir massiv cake after he is caught steal a dessert . matilda is just twist enough to be a perfect fairi tale . it is also characterist of the best children tale that they manag to teach lesson in such a way that children almost don't realiz that they are learn them . there is a hilari moment when matilda television-addict father snatch away the book she is read ( in a wick joke , he think _mobi dick_ is pornograph ) and forc her to watch an inan game show ( host by jon lovitz ) in which contest are smear with adhes and place in a booth fill with cash blow around . matilda is a stori which promot the valu of intellectu curios over passiv entertain , and it doe so while poke hole in that most frustrat of notion for a child -- that becaus " i'm big and you'r littl , i'm right and you'r wrong . " more specif , it has as it heroin an intellig , self-confid girl who struggl success against other peopl notion of how she should behav . it is no coincid that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contribut the superb recent adapt of littl women . final , matilda has that qualiti i find rarest and most treasur in famili entertain : it is famili entertain in the truest sens of the word . devito know enough to make matilda fast-pac and appeal to children , take a delici nasti perform by pam ferri as miss trunchbul and make it the focal point of some priceless physic comedi , includ a great chase through her dark hous . the child actor are win but never obnoxi ador , with mara wilson make matilda a clever and extrem likeabl charact . but there are also mani , mani delight for adult , includ my favorit scene in which matilda use her power to frighten miss trunchbul by have chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda classmat recit in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reuben as an fbi agent stake out matilda father . i can't imagin anyon of ani age leav matilda feel as though his or her intellig had been insult . matilda is a film which left me glow with good feel . i will see it again , and year from now i will watch it with my children . and now i will stop , becaus somewher near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child .

0 okay , bear with me y'all , caus first off i have to get this off my chest : what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ? whew . okay . caus that same clip shown over and over again was begin to get on my nerv toward the end , as cute as the crab mayb . even i know that you need more footag than * that * . and that wasn't the onli thing get on my nerv . the cutesi gimmick , saccharin sweet score / soundtrack and the pretti young face of sarah michell gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flanneri ( as tom ) might have held some appeal dure , oh , say the first 10 minut of the movi . at first the movi move along at a quick , interest pace . it is speedili establish that someth magic is about to happen to amanda when she encount a total random fairi godfath type person on the street , whose aforement crab follow her everywher and just * doesn't * die . a ridicul concept , yes , but at this point i'm will to accept it becaus i'm will to accept that this is how amanda life is chang , how her power are receiv . later on , the movi can't seem to decid whether these power come from this fairi godfath or from amanda fall in with tom . and this is whi the clip of the crab were annoy ; they weren't just repetit , they were out of place and unnecessari . the plot stumbl along at an uneven speed , sometim dwell too long on a particular develop ( amanda sudden becom a great chef , her fall in love with tom , etc . ) , sometim move on too quick for it own good . some place the plot just doesn't make sens , sometim it way too contriv ( the crab bit , for exampl ) , and sometim too corni ( peach emit dri ice . can't beat that ) . all in all the plot seem fragment , unconnect . not romant at all , and onli funni in some place . so , okay , do the magic power come from the crab ? or the fairi godfath ? she can * float * now too ? and all of a sudden , instead of just make dri ice come out of peach , she can put her emot into her food ? tom all of a sudden just accept amanda " witchcraft " in the end ? would peopl realli dine in a restaur that resembl life after death in tupac video ? what the hell is up with that damn crab ? it is unfortun , becaus i like the basic premis of the movi , until it becam too fantast and tiresom . the film seem to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but toward the end it resolv to show us long flashback clip and 5 minut of peopl cri at their tabl . the humor was good in some place ( nolan get the funniest bit , includ that incomprehens , total random thing with the doll ) . gellar and flanneri are qualifi actor , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her play the sauci buffi ( or even annett in the upcom " cruel intent " ) than this sorri excus for a charact . it almost funni sometim to see these two tri so hard to make the dialogu sound better than it is , or tri to make the relationship seem more plausibl . the support charact nolan was a highlight , though he remind me a bit of kevin in " you'v got mail " ( see footnot ) . and , as alway , typic of a chick flick / romant comedi , there a seem endless romant soundtrack in the background , cu up at all the right place . this sort of got on the nerv after a while , too . " simpli irresist " is not hard to understand , light , funni in some place , and general disappoint becaus it can't draw the line between romanc and protract sap , between humor and tire slapstick . and how could i refrain from make a pun ? . . . " simpli irresist " is all too easi to resist . ( first view , 2/6/99 ) * did anyon els think this was a tad bit similar to " you'v got mail " ( or " the shop around the corner " ) ? busi rival fall in love . femal counterpart busi is in danger of be shut down . femal as mother- like figur guid her . the annoy , hyster ex-girlfriend . * i _really_ like sarah michell gellar wardrob .
0 anna and the king is at least the fourth film adapt of margaret landon fact base novel the king and i , and it big , expens and soulless . though good-look , it lavish set , fanci costum and luscious cinematographi can do littl to compens for the emot wasteland that is peter krike and steve meerson script . so much money was spent on pretti pictur that they forgot to actual make the movi interest . this is jodi foster first movi sinc the jaw-drop brilliant contact came out more than two year ago and it isn't the best choic to show off her act chop . she trap in the stoic role of anna leonowen , the uptight , widow british schoolteach who come to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king ( chow yun-fat ) son in the way of the west ( becaus " the way of england are the way of the world ) . the king like her so much he put her in charg of educ the whole royal famili ( 58 kid with 10 more in the way ; impress , no ? ) . the eldest princ is none too happi about this ( " father , have i offend you in some way ? whi do you punish me with imperialist schoolteach ? ) , but soon get to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you person better and come to like her . meanwhil , siam come under attack from the neighbor british coloni of burma . the king and his close advisor suspect that this is britain do which arous suspicion in siam , put anna in an uncomfort posit . she is not sure what to make of this and seem to herself suspect british involv in the crisi but work to diffus the king prejudic . he , though self-right as ever , can't help but be influenc by the eloqu anna and they slowli , quiet , develop affect for each other . there is a scene in the middl of anna and the king where one of the king younger daughter die . it your classic deathb scene , with the girl mourn eye stare at her father , who tri onli semi- success to maintain his composur . anna then come in and cri a bit . the sequenc was there for a purpos : to evok a strong emot respons from the viewer . i'm usual a sucker for such scene and yet this time , i was just sit there , my emot untouch . this remain true through all of the movi which remain emot barren . we never develop connect to the charact ; never given a reason to care . this ludicr long epic was direct by andi tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorit of 1998 . i do not doubt tennant abil to put togeth a decent movi , but anna and the king , asid from be psycholog inept is also technolog defici . the set and sceneri are gorgeous , but the camerawork doe noth to convey it grandeur . even terrenc malick manag to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwis abysm the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of prop and a shoot in malaysia . we feel like the camera is restrict to it immedi point of view ; there are no wide track shot or sweep zoom to fill us with larger-than-lif awe . i like both foster and yun-fat , who give entertain if not terribl involv perform in the two lead role . foster general stoic persona serv her well here , as she is play a reserv , formal and rather underdevelop charact . yun-fat is especi effect , perfect convey the king of siam sangfroid permeat with violent outburst . what doe anna and the king in is it inabl to involv the viewer in it charact and situat . the cast is great , the director is talent , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advis remak of the classic roger and hammerstein movi is unabl to util ani of those thing to form a compel whole . this is an emotionless costum epic .

( the cast also includ christoph lambert , who has appear in the highland and mortal kombat film . ) how on earth this movi got two big-nam star to appear in it is beyond me . adrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten year in the futur ( 2007 ) . boston has chang dramat in those ten year . it is now home to a bunch of inter foreign and polic by cop who drive around in small car with " policia " print on their door . some guy has a realli bad virus , and he kill peopl becaus of it . so , the brave good guy ( lambert and henstridg ) go after him . that it . 76 minut never seem so long . this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandon build turn into an entir movi . the plot develop is nil ; we learn absolut noth about lambert charact and veri littl about henstridg charact . the dialogu is litter with unnecessari obscen and concern mindnumb idiot argument over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carri the flashlight . a subplot doe exist involv henstridg charact illeg attempt to get her son out of boston . in her open monologu , a monologu which sound as though henstridg was read from cue card , we learn that she has gone to great length to secur a fake passport for her son . twenti minut into the film , i wonder if the movi would have been better if it focus on this plot . in a defin scene of the movi , howev , i chang my mind . this fake passport drop to the ground . lambert cop immedi recogn it as a fraud from six feet away . must not have been a good fake . this emphas anoth fault with the film . thing just defi common sens . lambert cop , for instanc , is shot seven time , yet he is still abl to talk and slide about . adrenalin : fear the rush end in a trite manner that doesn't seem to even fit the mood that the filmmak were tri for . i found myself rather bore with this film , which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fan and fan of henstridg and lambert . don't fear the rush . fear the movi . watch someth els .

0 die hard 2 is an altogeth unfortun fiasco , inferior to the origin in everi respect . place the blame squar on the shoulder of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film pathet screenplay . everi line of dialogu reek of either smarmi sap or forc humor . the plot is altogeth implaus ; the convolut stori line involv a band of terrorist who take over dull airport and shut down the control tower , leav a dozen plane strand in the air wait to land . the film has zero credibl , and all of the charact come off as clich , cardboard cut-out . so much for the script . how about the action ? well , let put it this way : director renni harlin could learn a few thing from john mctiernan , who direct the origin , as well as the hunt for red octob and predator--al standout for their hair-rais suspens . by contrast , harlin doesn't have a clue when it come to choreograph action , and consequ , die hard 2 never pick up steam . die harder is imposs to take serious even for a minut . in fact , the movi often seem deliber campi , and it almost reach the threshold of be so bad it good . you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it . die hard 2 should have never been clear for takeoff .
0 all featur film director who cut their teeth on music video , pleas rais your hand . thank you for identifi yourselv ; now would you all pleas go away . your influenc has to rank as one of the most annoy trend in filmmak in the last decad , and it show no sign of abat ani time soon . it isn't just the strobe light qualiti of your twenty-cuts-per-minut edit , or the numb over-us of popular music artist on the soundtrack which make me suspici of ani film advertis " featur the music of . . . " no , it is a kind of cynic you have perfect , bank on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a stori if you includ enough bell and whistl . welcom to the club , scott kalvert . your adapt of the basketbal diari is loud and one-dimension , serv onli as the vehicl for a perform by leonardo dicaprio that is better in piec than it is as a whole . dicaprio star as jim carrol , the new york poet/songwriter/ perform on whose autobiograph write the film is base . as the film open , jim is a bud high school basketbal star given to petti thieveri and get drunk with buddi mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( jame madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) . one night , jim graduat from inhal to cocain , and short thereaft to heroin . jim addict to the drug start him on a downhil spiral , as he is kick off the basketbal team by his coach ( bruno kirbi ) , kick out of his home by his mother ( lorrain bracco ) , and drop out of school . along with mickey and pedro , jim becom a victim of the street , live from fix to fix and sink lower and lower . the basketbal diari has been bounc around as a project for year , but the stick point has alway been that jim carrol as a charact was too unsympathet and too much a loner . screenwrit bryan goluboff creat the three charact who act as carrol poss , result in a jim carrol who is just as unsympathet , but now with equal unsympathet friend . as a film , the basketbal diari may be intend primarili as a cautionari tale , a 100 minut long " just say no " public servic announc , but as drama it is monument ineffect becaus it is imposs to care much about anyon in the movi . jim is sort of a jerk even befor he becom a junki , but i suppos that his pseudo-sensit poetri and his devot to his termin ill friend are intend to balanc that out . perhap we are expect to see jim as one of those " good kid who fall in with the wrong crowd " that everi parent believ his or her troubl child to be ; i saw him simpli as part of the bad crowd . without a charact who chang in ani appreci way , the basketbal diari rapid degener into a collect of crime commit by jim and his strung-out cohort , all choreograph to an oppress loud soundtrack . director scott kalvert doesn't have mani scene with intrins dramat impact with which to work , so he substitut silli slow-mot photographi , self-consci funki camera angl and choppi edit . on onli one occas , when a steadi pan around a room where jim is tri to detox make it appear that the wall are close in , are ani of the gimmick effect . most , they just draw attent to how hollow the stori is . they also don't allow leonardo dicaprio perform to be as strong as it could have been . for everi impress moment , like his desper attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pull too much of the focus to his own camera theatric . dicaprio is most effect when he is play off other actor , particular a fine sequenc featur erni hudson as an ex-junki who tri to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won't let charact interact defin this stori . he want to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shoot him in dramat fashion but deni him the opportun to do much act . at isol moment , the basketbal diari is a fine showcas for dicaprio talent . far more frequent , it look like kalvert is tri to imagin what a long form velvet underground video might have look like .
0 my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pull " dragnet " rerun off the air . sure , i'd seen them all at least onc , but i could alway count on at least a few inadvert laugh from ultra-seri jack webb when there was noth els on tv . even though " dragnet " is out of circul at the moment , we webb anti-fan still have the d . i . , a 50 propaganda piec for the militari that is almost as hilari as the famous " blue boy " episod of " dragnet . " for anyon like me who got laugh out of webb rapid-fir speech and straight-fac serious , think of the d . i . as what would happen if sgt . joe friday ever enlist , becaus he play exact the same charact here , a no-nonsens old fart who look with disdain at the younger generat and love to give long- wind , melodramat speech on ani topic . in this elect year , i'm more convinc than ever that webb and bob dole were separ at birth . the movi open in characterist fashion as one recruit after anoth knock on webb offic door and enter . he give each one a differ seri of cranki critic befor the credit come up . the " produc and direct by jack webb " card pretti much goe without say . this is his movi all the way , and after the first twenti minut of him chew out his recruit for no reason , i was wonder if there would even be a plot . i certain would have been entertain by an hour and a half of trademark webb rant , but the d . i . give us more -- much more . webb mission is to make a man out of privat owen , the local screw-up . the captain give webb three day to convert owen into marin materi or , the captain will " person cut the lace off his panti and ship him out myself . " ( whether the " lace panti " part refer to webb or owen remain unansw . ) this , of cours , give webb an excus to focus all his crotcheti energi on make owen life a live hell . for those of you who haven't been indoctrin into the pleasur of webb watch , here a reprint of a typic monologu of his . i can't duplic his hilari deliveri on paper , but the word should at least partial convey what i'm talk about . . . " now you listen to me , youngster . someday you'll wake up fight on a beach and you'll pray to god somebodi doesn't get kill becaus of your foolish . . . i'v got a headlin for you : everi time you make one of those littl mistak of your , you'r gonna turn around and i'll be stand right there . " i couldn't write down all the reprint dialogu from the d . i . ( near all of it belong in the bad movi hall of fame ) , but i tri to includ some of the more noteworthi line , like one from the scene where webb unwind from a hard day work by go to the local bar ( where he order a tomato juic ) . he meet a woman who , coincident , also order tomato juic but walk away from a typically-stimul convers with webb to flirt with his arch-riv , anoth marin d . i . webb march over to the tabl , get up in her face and say , " just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? " bogart he ain't . the other d . i . get one of the few memor non-webb line when he confess to the girl , " he a damn good d . i . . . . i guess i'm just a littl jealous . " join the club , we'r all jealous of jack webb way with women , which is showcas even more amus in a later scene , as webb find his way to the woman place of employ , a lingeri store , and stand around look incred fluster at the neglige on display . " you expect me to talk to you . . . in _here_ ? ! " he exclaim , no doubt intimid by the barrag of bras . the woman goe off to help a custom , leav webb to fend for himself onc again in this palac of estrogen . a littl girl spot him in the store and demand , " what are you do in here . . . you'r a man , aren't you ? " he doesn't repli , but you know he think in his head , " what an odd speci of human -- so small . must be one of those children everyon been talk about . " this poor girl , scar for life by her earli encount with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entir , just one of the mani lesbian convers he respons for . the movi doesn't focus too close on webb romanc , it also continu the owen subplot with probabl the most memor scene in the entir movi , where webb forc his platoon to spend the entir night search the ground for a flea owen kill dure one of their drill . after two privat hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb ask owen , " was that flea you kill a male or femal ? " owen repli , " a male , sir . " webb yell to the platoon , " this ain't the one ! " that such a scene ( along with the rest of the movi ) was intend to be taken serious defi comment . but we know it was all present with the utmost serious when a titl card at the end thank the marin not onli for their cooper in the make of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcan and everi other major battl of the first half of the 20th centuri . webb held the militari in such high esteem that all the soldier in the movi ( with the except of owen ) were play by actual marin . someon want to parodi this movi couldn't do a more comic job than webb did . it make it all the more iron ( like raeeyain on your wed day ) that the man had no sens of humor himself . there a scene in the movi where the guy are on their break time discuss someth and one of them break into laughter . webb burst in the room and shout , " what did i tell you about laugh ? ! " to which the privat repli , " sir , onli nine-year-old girl laugh , sir ! " and let me tell you , i was as happi as a nine-year- old girl while watch this movi .
0 " idl hand " is distast , crass and deriv . if an origin thought found it way into this horror-comedi it would die of loneli . plus , you have to question the judgment and sensit of studio execut who would green light the releas of a movi deal with the slaughter of innoc teen-ag the week after the tragedi in littleton , colo . the movi is insult to horror film fan and teen-ag . the plot , what littl there is , deal with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high-school slacker who hand goe on a murder rampag after becom possess . along the way the hand kill anton parent and his two best friend . the friend , also slacker , are so lazi that they return from the dead becaus the walk into the light was too far for them . that is the level of this atroc humor . the movi treat death as a joke . " idl hand " is gruesom and morbid . the perform are stereotyp and cartoonish . i realiz this is suppos to pass for comedi , but recent event have surpass what is on the screen . it is not the fault of the filmmak that real life has overtaken reel life . and i can onli presum that the writer of " idl hand , " terri hugh and ron milbauer , were tri to make some statement about today young peopl and their valu in a satir vein . howev , it hard to laugh at death these day , especi one involv young peopl . with the real horror of the world put befor us on televis , a stale pastri such as " idl hand " should be held from releas for a few week or month to give us time to catch our collect breath . " idl hand " is bad , no matter the circumst in the world outsid . but the context of recent event onli heighten it shortcom . the time is not right for this type of movi . and as far as " idl hand " goe , the time may never be right . this is a movi that shoud be consign to the trash bin of cinema .
0 stallon attempt to act in this cop drama . the film is set in a neighbourhood pratic built by kietal , who nephew ( play by michael rappaport ) is involv in a car crash and kill of two black youth . keital dosen't realli want to get involv in anyth , get rid of rappaport , and stallon and de niro tri to work out what the hell is go on . this film should be brilliant . it sound like a great plot , the actor are first grade , and the support cast is good aswel , and stallon is attempt to deliv a good perform . howev , it can't hold up . although the act is fantast ( even stallon isn't bad ) the direct and stori is dull and long wind some scene go on for too long , with noth realli happen in them . in fact , the onli scene that do work are action scene , which i suspect stallon was tri to avoid . in this film , serious mean dull . the dialogu is warbl , and basic just repeat the same point over and over , no matter who is deliv them . the plot , which has potenti , is wast , again just be clich after a while . in fact , the onli thing that doe keep the film go is kietal and de niro , both deliv their usual good perform . howev , stallon , although not given much to say , give a good perform . howev , it not all that bad . as said abov , the action scene are well done . there also a veri good end , which use the cinema sound system well . in fact , the last 10 minut of this 2 hour film are one of the best end of 1997 . if onli the rest of the film was as good as the end . cop land , then , turn out not to be a power hous film , but a rather dull , and not everi excit film . huge disappoint , and i can't realli recommend it .
1 there a thin line between satir and controversi , and mike nichol ( the birdcag , wolf ) has direct a sharp and veri honest look at a us presidenti elect . base on the book written by " anonym " ( actual former " newsweek " writer joe klein ) , john travolta play governor jack stanton . but he doesn't actual play stanton . he play bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt play the first ladi and billi bob thorton is the campaign manipul jame carvill ( although the credit will of cours say otherwis ) . the film is taken from the perspect of henri burton ( adrian lester ) , a moral correct and somewhat hesit new advisor to stanton . he search for justic and digniti in the ugliest possibl situat , and whether it be keep the histori of his boss pant under wrap or contempl dig up dirt on anoth politician , he approach his work with a keen desir to skill serv his countri and his fellow worker . richard jemmon ( billi bob thorton ) and daisi green ( maura tierney ) team up with henri as the would-b presid advisor , and hire lesbian veteran libbi holden ( kathi bate ) as the campaign eccentr " tougher than dirt " incrimin . togeth they face all sort of sexual alleg , the irrit discourt media and other witti politician in the elect race . in it satir and controversi , primari color is a similar film to wag the dog : they both are not afraid to wipe their nose in the nitty-gritti and take a bold look at someth that will never has honesti as a virtu . but wherea wag show us how much affect a few peopl can have on the media , primari color is much more concern with flesh out it charact , let us understand what they want and whi , and make us truli appreci the human and rectitud that they gracious repres . see john travolta play bill clinton so confid and just is enough to make the film more than worth a look . and the rest of the cast also make superb perform - adrian lester sharpli portray the intellect of henri whilst kathi bate is perfect as the robust and energet libbi holden . at occas , you can't help but feel that these terrif charact are go to wast . there are long slab of time where john travolta ( unquestion the most interest to watch ) is miss from the screen ; and sinc it is awkward structur as henri stori we are often forc to watch scene that perhap are not so necessari to the central plot - or even the point of the film . have said that , make no mistak - primari color is alway enjoy to watch . but frequent we have to ask ourselv - exact what are we watch ? most of the first half of it durat is a lighthead look at melodramat confront that seem so genuin we cannot help but laugh , but the way primari color choos to finish tackl aspect that are veri contrari , and almost unsuit , to the rest of the film . but as i mention befor , there is a thin line between satir and controversi - and for the most part , primari color deliv an entertain indulg of polit matter combin with a far-from-overpow look at win the public opinion . although at occas the film may jump around a littl too freeli , focus is never lost on how import and vulner the subject matter realli is . thank , it is clear to make the distinct on what is entertain movi cosmet and what is a provoc document of someth so realli it scari .

0 john boorman " zardoz " is a goofi cinemat debacl so fundament misconceiv and laughabl execut that it take on a bizarr enjoy qualiti all it own . not sinc the rampant bumbl of one edward d . wood jr . has a movi been so silli and so serious at the same time . of cours , wood career can be explain by two thing : he had no money and he had no talent . boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excus to explain " zardoz " ( or his follow-up film , the equal aw " exorcist ii : the heret " ) . boorman obvious had a sizabl budget , a matine idol movi star ( sean conneri ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman doe inde have talent . this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiec " deliver " ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiograph world war ii drama " hope and glori " ( 1987 ) , the slight over-conceiv arthurian epic " excalibur " ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungl adventur " the emerald forest " ( 1985 ) . his film all show that boorman is never lack in imagin , but sometim that come at the cost of coher and tast . if boorman is anyth , he ambiti , and when he succeed , it in grand fashion . unfortun , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman fall , the resound impact can be heard for mile around . " zardoz " is meant to take it place among the grandest of mystic movi , an obsess of boorman . his screenplay tri to elicit the same mytholog connot of the arthurian legend or even " the wizard of oz , " a book which figur into the movi plot . but , despit all this reach , the result movi is more unintent funni than intent enigmat or compel . the event take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is littl of the typic futurist movie- to be found . in fact , thing seem to have move backward , with peopl ride hors , shoot old-styl gun , and live in larg victorian mansion . it more middl age than space age . the world of " zardoz " is divid into two distinct hemispher : the outland , where all the poor , pathet peopl live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthi intellectu live in comfort and everlast life . these immort never grow old , they never engag in sexual activ , they possess psycholog power , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist societi where everyon is equal , and everyon contribut equal to the societi . howev , if one break the rule , that person is punish by be age so mani year . if someon break the rule enough , he or she is age to the point of senil , and imprison to an etern exist in a geriatr home with other age crimin . one of the immort , arthur frayn ( niall buggi ) , a squirmi man with a mustach and goate tattoo on his face , is charg with keep order in the outland and forc the resid to farm so the immort can be fed . like " the wizard of oz , " he adopt a god-lik status among the peopl by fli in to their part of the world in a giant stone carv like a menac head . ( this fli head is one of the movi open imag , and it a dead giveaway of the lunaci to come . ) call himself zardoz , frayn gather a bunch of outland and make them into a group call the extermin , whose purpos is to kill most of the other outland so they can't procreat and take up more resourc . from insid his giant , stone head , zardoz bellow serious laugh-induct statement like , " the gun is good . the peni is evil . " that line alon is worth the movi cult follow . one day , an extermin name zed ( sean conneri ) , sneak into zardoz fli stone , push frayn out , and goe back to the vortex . onc there , the immort label him a " brutal " and studi him like a lab rat , take great , pervers care in explor his sexual , which is a mysteri to them . they seem especi interest in his abil to gain an erect , and there is one downright hilari sequenc where a bunch of scantily-clad femal scientist show zed erot footag on a video screen in an attempt to determin what get him work up . i say " hilari " becaus that is exact what " zardoz " is . it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of face , although i have a hard time believ that as product move forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkl of how patent ridicul it was becom . just look at conneri is enough to give one the giggl - he spend most of the film run around in a red loin cloth that resembl a diaper , a mane of hair braid halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-styl handlebar mustach , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boot that would look more appropri on a cheap hollywood hooker . boorman made the film right after the critic and financi success of " deliver , " which is the onli reason i can imagin a studio would green-light this effort . he attract some rich talent on both side of the camera , includ cinematograph geoffrey unsworth ( " 2001 " ) , whose strike visual are about the onli good thing in " zardoz " besid the inadvert humor . sean conneri had made his last jame bond film in 1971 , and perhap he was look for a chang in pace . he got exact that in " zardoz , " and it a wonder it didn't end his career . i'm sure boorman intend for this movi to make some grand statement . is it a treatis about the infal of etern life ? is it a condemn of those who consid grow old to be a bad thing ? or is it a social statement , someth about the inher negat of class distinct and the violenc it creat ? karl marx might like it if he were more like timothi leari . come to think of it , mayb boorman made it as an extend lsd trip . peopl high on illicit substanc are the onli one i can imagin enjoy this asinin silli as anyth more than a complet unintent comedi .

1 an indian runner was more than a courier . he * becam * the messag he was carri . what danger is a bear , to a messag ? i use to think sean penn was an immatur , arrog , photographer- punch , madonna-marri , loudmouth . but all that has chang now . the guy has grown up . and that not all . it seem that sean penn has talent both as a writer and a director , if this film is ani indic . one might imagin a movi with plenti of ruthless rage and showi machismo , given penn in charg of bronson and and hopper . but , no . this film is about a real struggl , and the victori and defeat are not simpl . penn let the stori unfold at a pace dictat by the live of the charact , without unnecessari rush or flash . the focus of the stori is two brother . david mors is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were rais , tend a fail farm and final becom a polic offic . viggo mortensen is the wild brother , whose wild behavior seem to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can't name , much less resolv . the film pick the stori up on the day when mortensen return from vietnam , and mors coincident encount an arm youth flee for the state line . it becom clear that some kind of conflict threaten the link that the brother onc share . the film is unobtrus , simpl , direct , plain , and sincer . it isn't exact perfect , but it sincer is well invest in the struggl of the two brother to identifi the sick befor it destroy them . life seem to move forward a littl faster than they can get a handl on their problem . this is a good film without big budget set , or big name star push into your face . in fact , i'm review it becaus i suspect that it may not get much market . there were perhap 10 other at the show i saw . i thought the structur was clean and not oversimplifi , though there are a few free-form section which also work veri well . the obligatori 1960s music seem a littl clich , but what are you go to do--thi movi * doe * take place in the 1960s after all . in my opinion , it is worth full-pric admiss .

0 written by alex cox , tod davi , terri gilliam and toni grisoni direct by terri gilliam i'v alway prefer mushroom to blotter acid . drop acid is like ride a roller coaster blindfold ; you have no idea where the peak and valley are , no idea when the next terrifi decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last . then there the hard knot in your gut and the clench teeth that come with ingest a strychnine-lac dose . mushroom , on the other hand , offer the psychedel equival of a leisur ride on a ferri wheel : a steadi , reassur assent , a short period of thrill motion and color , and then a smooth land . acid is for daredevil ; mushroom are for refin seeker of joy . my point is that in fear and loath in las vega , director terri gilliam has made an acid movi , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movi . full of shock sight gag , aggress imag and grotesqu comic perform , the film certain offer someth for those fan of hunter s . thompson book who want to experi it twist pharmacolog world-view from the insid out . but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-mad film , gilliam has produc a mix bag . fear and loath tell the ostens true stori of how self-profess " gonzo " journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnni depp ) and hispan activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vega to cover a motorcycl race and found themselv trap in the middl of a district attorney convent while ingest everi conceiv drug avail to a man of mean in 1971 . oper under the pseudonym of " raoul duke " and " dr . gonzo " , the two men careen into vega on an acid and mescalin bender , then hole up in a hotel suit to bing on amyl nitrit , cocain , tequila and a rainbow of multi-color upper and downer . they terror everi one they meet , most becaus everi one they meet terrifi them . duke hallucin giant bat on the way into town , then is attack by horrifi lizard in the casino loung . dr . gonzo becom enamor of a thick-blad hunt knife and beg duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplan " white rabbit " reach it climax . and these guy don't just trash hotel room - they rape them , humili them and leav them for dead . that neither of them end up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or provid , depend on your point of view . thompson book , besid be a hilari read , has stood the test of time as an import histor document . it simultan expos the 60 drug cultur for the sham that it was and expos las vega as the place where the american dream came to die . pontif all you want about how the film illustr thompson messag , but the truth is that , strip to it bare essenti , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedi . it a cheech and chong movi . you'r there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemic and then laugh at the result : see johnni take drug , see johnni fall down . there noth wrong with this concept , but gilliam tri too hard . this is a frantic movi - all sweati close-up , wide-angl lens , dutch tilt and other-world light scheme . there are time when gilliam realli doe put a convinc represent of an acid trip on the screen . but to what end ? much of the dialogu come verbatim from thompson book , and there are some priceless comic observ . but you'r hard press to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbl camera work . this bring us to the perform , which strike me as all wrong . depp play thompson as groucho mark filter through georg c . scott in patton - a gimmicki perform which work against the bite satir of thompson dialogu . in between his sever puke scene , del toro fare better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbl and sputter so mani of his line that their weight is lost . watch these two made me wish that the movi had been made twenti year ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the lead - now that would have been someth to see . it interest to note that alex cox , credit as a co-writ on the screenplay , was origin slate to direct befor gilliam took over . as much of a fan as i am of gilliam work , cox would have been the better choic . sid and nanci , cox best work , cover essenti the same subject matter , but cox was abl to pull back and allow the charact of sid vicious and nanci spungen to carri the film . gilliam commit the compound sin of over-direct his film while be uncertain of his purpos . what kind of movi was he tri to make , anyway ? it doesn't tri to be a cautionari tale , and it doesn't work as broad comedi . if he had consid more care his purpos , the result would have been a much more interest film . but i don't want to be too hard on it . there are some truli funni moment , and if you'r in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . i do , howev , recommend watch fear and loath in las vega under the influenc of your favorit control substanc - i guarante it will enhanc the effect .
0 that is , unless you'r one of those peopl who have seen the preview a thousand time on tv or in the theater . i can tell you one thing now : they gave the entir movi away . whi someon would want to base an entir movi on one premis and then give that crucial detail away in the trailer is beyond me . howev , if they * hadn't * given it away , the film would'v still been supris devoid of suspens given it subject matter . obvious , the produc thought they could remak " the deep end of the ocean , " throw in tommi lee jone and a coupl of clich and call it an action drama . " doubl jeopardi " offer solid act from ashley judd and tommi lee jone , who got first bill even though he didn't see to be on screen half as much as judd did . it also offer some genuin funni , clever , or full-of-tens moment ( my favorit : judd wake up in the coffin ) , but none of that can salvag the film from it insan predict plot . half the time i'm wonder whether i'm watch one of those overhyp tv miniseri , which alway turn out to be less excit than advertis . judg by the begin , end , and a huge chunk of the middl , i might have been watch a special hallmark present too . the movi stretch for an almost two hour long film with onli 30 minut worth of materi . implaus materi , no less . loos interpret of one of the amend asid , too mani time in the movi i thought , " that is * not * possibl * . " that kind of stuff is excus in popcorn movi , but not one like " doubl jeopardi " that tri to pass itself off as serious drama . everyth seem drag out , overplay . when they should'v kept us in the dark , they let the cat out of the bag too earli .
0 some movi pre-releas buzz is so insist on their high oscar potenti that when they'r final releas , everyon just goe along with it . thus sometim , film unworthi of ani award san the razzi becom oscar hope and some even score nomin . last year it was the thin red line . this year " winner " is the hurrican , pure unadulter tripe that is all of a sudden be receiv with critic plaudit and vote in the offic oscar pool . acclaim director norman jewison biopic retread all the convent of courtroom movi without ani of the fun . and that suppos to be ok becaus , see , it a true stori . it about rubin " hurrican " carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendari african american prizefight who is unjust convict of tripl homicid with the help of a ghast ( racist ! ) detect ( dan hedaya ) who had it in for the " big-shot " hurrican ever sinc he arrest him for stab a white man with a knife ( in self-defens but who care , right ? ) when rubin was onli ten . he is to serv three life sentenc with no possibl of parol . most of the film take place when he is in his 15th year in prison . to the rescu -- lesra martin ( vicel reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-b detect . lesra is an african american teenag taken in by three well-off canadian white peopl ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an educ . lesra and his buddi go to a book sale where lesra pick out his veri first book -- " the sixteenth round , " rubin autobiographi . immedi thereaft , schreiber charact tell lesra " sometim we don't pick the book we read , they pick us . " hmmm . after a few visit to the prison , they becom convinc of rubin innoc and launch their own full-scal investig even though two juri have convict him . they meticul go through all the file and revisit all the old wit ( i wonder if ani of them might be cranki old women who slam the door in their face ? ) and in the cours of their relentlessi tedious sleuth uncov obvious evid confirm the hurrican innoc that was either ignor or never seek out dure the first two proceed . of cours , we'r alreadi told that he innoc . a movi like this is especi frustrat becaus we'r not be shown everyth signific that happen to carter dure this period in his life . all too obvious , we'r get the hollywood watered- down version . that would be ok except that the part we are get is milk for everi singl drop of melodrama that the filmmak could possibl squeez out of it . it almost cruel . the melodrama isn't of the entertain kind either ; it the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat varieti where everi emot is exagger to the point of absurd . wit the villain feroci grind his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintli of our four protagonist . the hurrican is your basic courtroom movi except it a no-fril courtroom movi . it formula strip to the bare necess . you have your wrong accus black man . you have your melodramat final courtroom scene . but there noth els . you'd expect some sort of involv investig . but that not necessari sinc we'r implicit inform of his innoc . thus the whole middl portion of the movi is reduc to the protagonist brood . brood to himself . brood to other inmat . brood to lesra . brood to lesra canadian friend . brood in letter . i don't think i'll ever look at brood the same way again . it wasn't long befor i got tire of hear the hurrican exceed deep medit on his condit . i want someth to happen . as for washington perform in the titl role -- i figur i'd have to address it sooner or later consid the amount of attent it receiv -- he is top notch , though still bore . how is that possibl ? well , he doe what jewison want him to do perfect . unfortun what jewison ask him to do is a load of crap . what a wast of a great perform . speak of wast , whi the hell did john hannah agre to do this ? he an extrem talent actor and i love him dear , but what is he do here ? to call his charact ( along with schreiber and unger ) a stick figur would be a gross understat . all three of them come off as verit mother theresa , as benevol as do-good come . if they'r to play a major part in this movi , whi not make them real peopl , with real feel and emot ? look : if you'r go to make a formula movi , don't undermin the formula . courtroom drama can be fun , but this is ridicul . not onli is it trite , it bore .
1 when i saw the trailer for this film , i laugh harder than i had in quit some time . while i was therefor pretti well psych to see it , i was ever mind that a trailer can make even the most mediocr film look good . i'm happi to say that there someth about mari is not one of those trailer let-down . in fact , watch this film was quit a fine way to spend two hour . the film open up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcom prom , until he come to the defens of the mental retard warren ( w . earl brown ) , who be harass by one of the school jock . it seem warren sister is the campus queen , mari jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impress with ted willing to stand up for her defenseless brother , despit a veri real chanc of get beaten up . mari take an immedi like to ted and ask him to the prom . ted was just flatter that she even knew his name . unfortun , prom night is ruin when ted has an accid with his zipper ( at which everi man in the theater will winc ) , and is sent to the hospit . fast forward to the present , where ted has clean himself up , now write for a magazin , but has week therapi session in order to deal with his obsess of the past 13 year : mari , whom he hasn't seen sinc that fate day . with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hire slimi privat investig pat heali ( matt dillon ) to track down his onli love . howev , when pat find mari , he fall for her too , and soon the both of them are compet for her affect . there someth about mari is direct by bobbi and peter farrelli , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . not exact intellig comedi , they are of the guilti pleasur varieti where you might not want your friend or co-work to think you had such a great time watch them . with their current film , the farrelli brother have come up with someth you'll not onli enjoy , but also won't mind talk about the next day at the water cooler . the film succeed in employ a pretti wide rang of comed style , from the subtl to the ridicul , and while a few of the gag might be offens to some ( seem like residu from the farrelli brother last two film ) they almost all work . i have not seen mani movi in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . one minut you'll be laugh at someth ted say , and the next you'll be howl at the sight of a dog drag him across the floor of mari apart . one of the great thing this film has go for it is ben stiller . he is perfect cast in the role of ted , becaus he a guy who just look awkward in almost everi situat . ted a nice fellow and tri to do his best , but for some reason or anoth thing just don't alway work out . it comic , but also has that kind of appeal where you realli feel for the him and want him to come out on top . actual , i'v like stiller sinc he did a short which air on saturday night live back in the mid-eighti . the film was like a theatric trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitl the hustler of money . in it , stiller play winc ( not vinc ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( play by john mahoney ) to becom a big-tim bowl hustler . it was parodi at it finest , more of which show up in the short-liv " the ben stiller show " on the fox network in late 92/ear 93 . like " the critic " ( which air on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show cancel . cameron diaz is absolut enchant for most of the film , although her charact seem obsess with perfect in the men she date , and some of the qualiti she look for make mari look paper-thin at time . howev , diaz pull the role off with such panach and charm , that you can still see whi she got guy just fall over each other to be with her . heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoy dure an appear she made on the tonight show last week . my girlfriend remark that matt dillon doesn't chang , and you know , it realli true . he and ralph macchio must hang out or someth . mayb they live in dick clark pool hous . anyway , here anoth good piec of cast , as dillon slip beauti into the role of the guy who tri to worm his way into mari heart . the support perform are also good . chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoy than in cabin boy . lin shae , who play mari neighbor magda ( and also appear as the landladi in kingpin ) , provid some good laugh , especi in scene with her benji-lik dog , which act as the focal point for a few of the funniest moment of the film . lee evan , as mari friend tucker , display a flexibl in act and accent which surpris and contribut to an interest plot twist . the farrelli brother and scriptwrit ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comed pace go so that there aren't ani notic time where the film drag . the onli problem i saw was their use of a coupl of musician who provid segu between sever key scene . they appear out of nowher and actual sing plot-relev inform right toward the camera . it a devic which was amus for about three second when they open the film .

1 star war : episod 1 - the phantom menac ( 1999 ) review by matt pusateri few movi evok nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affect like georg luca 1977 classic , star war . the origin blockbust film and it two sequel not onli evok wonder and passion in a generat of filmgoer , but has deepli entrench itself in american pop cultur . arguabl , more american today can explain what " the forc " or a " jedi " is than a budget deficit or a serb . so 22 year after the releas of the origin , and 16 year sinc the third film , the return of the jedi , how can ani new star war film withstand the weight of incompar expect and anticip ? can a new storylin and a new cast of charact possibl compet with the legend of the first trilog - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultur icon ? against this challeng , the fourth star war film , episod one : the phantom menac hit the screen last week . and despit some earli critic review in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappoint . while the phantom menac is certain not the finest film in the seri , it is nonetheless engag , excit , and visual breathtak . it is a worthi sequel - er , prequel - to the origin star war film . the phantom menac take place decad befor the set of origin film . as the film open , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduc luke to the forc in the origin star war , is onli a young jedi apprentic , still learn from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . the republ govern has sent the two jedi to settl a trade disput that has develop into a blockad of the planet naboo by a shifti trade feder . the jedi quick find themselv not in negoti , but in the middl of a planetari invas , rush to protect naboo young queen amidala ( natali portman ) . later , after eventu rescu amidala and help her escap naboo , they are forc to stop at tatooin to repair their battle-damag ship befor bring her to the galact senat to make an appeal for justic . on tatooin , qui-gon discov a young slave boy , anakin skywalk ( jake lloyd ) , who not onli can help them get the part they need , but display uncanni intellig , insight , and instinct . qui-gon sens the child is " unusu strong " with the forc and begin to suspect that he may be " the one " prophes to " bring balanc to the forc . " as anyon who has watch the origin star war trilog know , far from be a galact savior , the innocent-look 9-year-old will in time becom the ruthless darth vader . complic matter further is a mysteri hood figur , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockad and invas of naboo , and send out a lethal apprentic , darth maul , to find and captur queen amidala . while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the dead and relentless darth maul . if the plot sound a bit complic , it is . the phantom menac not onli introduc an earlier generat of charact and an immedi crisi , but set up the foundat for the event that will eventu lead to the fall of the republ , the demis of the jedi knight , anakin turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empir of origin trilog . but the complex is not overwhelm . the stori move quick , with the onli drawback be that mani question , predict , remain unansw at the end of the film , set the stage for the next episod . one of the reason the film stori seem hazi is not that it is too confus , but too unfocus . it unclear whose stori phantom menac is . in the origin trilog , the movi were clear luke stori , with the stori center around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . but it unclear whether this new film is anakin stori or obi-wan . if this trilog is center on anakin , it a shaki foundat . lloyd , like mani child actor , lack the subtl act skill of adult perform , and as a result , his charact seem shallow and unimpress . on screen , we see noth that suggest a dark side lurk underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , ani presenc that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is will to believ he is " the one . " the rest of the cast doe fine , though they often work with some iffi dialogu by luca . neeson is perfect as an age jedi knight . mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and convey a balanc of youth energi and calm sensibl . portman fit the role of a young queen well , but her line were often veri formal , give her littl room to give her charact much person . the biggest problem with the phantom menac is not the plot or the charact , but the interact between them . individu , the charact in this new film are no less develop than those in the origin star war , and the storylin is not more confus than previous film in the seri . but unlik the previous trilog , luca doesn't do as good of a job play the charact off one anoth . in star war , there were immedi contrast and memor exchang between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . the ensembl play off each other and immedi show their distinct attitud and person . in the sequenc in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescu leia from her cell on the death star , the audienc learn a lot about all four charact in the way they react to the immedi problem and each other . there is no compar sequenc in the phantom menac to flesh out the charact and their relationship with each other . individu , they are interest charact with clear motiv and interest , but luca develop littl chemistri or tension between the them . this is perhap the most glare weak of this film , and is probabl the reason it has disappoint mani review . but despit the need for a richer dialogu and stronger charact interact , the film is still veri engag . mani of the wonder element of luca previous film make the phantom menac both memor and entertain . first , of cours , is the remark rich and imagin univers luca creat . the charact visit magic underwat citi , evad dinosaur-s sea monster , fight battl droid and menac " destroy " on venetian-look planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooin , then head to corsuc , the gothic urban capit of the republ and home to the galact senat and the jedi council . each locat is elabor and complex . luca never settl for vagu idea about the look of his set , he creat rich , spectacular landscap , palac , and skylin . most of the new special effect in his re-releas special edit trilog in 1997 were chang that allow him to give the earlier movi the look and feel that just weren't possibl when the film were made . more than ever , in this new film , luca univers is fill with a menageri of creatur , robot with person , and a support cast of alien who interact with the main charact . the best such charact is watto , a greedi tatooin junk dealer who own anakin and his mother as slave . watto has a scratchi italian voic and a short , paunchi bodi with odd mismatch wing that flutter like a hummingbird as he float around the room . of all the computer-gener charact in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoy . speak of computer-gener charact , no review of the phantom menac is complet without mention the most controversi figur in the film : jar jar bink . with more than 80 minut of screen time , jar jar is the realiz of georg luca dream to includ a fulli computer-gener charact into the cast of the new trilog . jar jar , a clumsi amphibian and member of the gungan race , liter stumbl his way into the path of the jedi knight earli in the film and becom qui jon accident sidekick . jar jar usual perform a comic-relief role in the film , lighten scene with his mishap and inabl to stay out of troubl . the anim of jar jar is near seamless , and he interact with the charact throughout the film as if he were realli on the set with the actor . howev , despit the technolog magic that make his charact possibl , jar jar isn't complet convinc . he still move and sound too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . throughout the movi , jar jar never transcend a " roger rabbit " -like presenc . you accept that he there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an anim charact . initi , i found jar jar annoy , but grew to enjoy the humor he ad to the film . on my second view of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all . a second reason this film continu the fine tradit of star war movi is that the film is replet with humor and small detail that flesh out the world luca creat . despit all the film struggl between good and evil , and the sober muse about one destini and " the forc , " like all star war film , the phantom menac never take itself too serious . fortun , luca hasn't lost sight of the fact that his film are entertain , not high art . from the bumbl jar jar , to a one-man , two-head announc team call the action at the film thrill pod-rac sequenc , to a cameo appear by e . t . in the film , the phantom menac is simpli a lot of fun , with lot of half-hidden joke and humor that can easili be miss . and final , the phantom menac work becaus , as in all his film , there is no shortag of speed and action . from begin to end , there are light-sab battl , hair-rais chase , and thrill duel between good and evil . the pod-rac sequenc on tatooin is one of the most entertain and excit scene in ani star war film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguabl the best choreograph , most thrill fight sequenc luca has film . the phantom menac won't win ani major oscar . it probabl won't beat titan box offic record . and it not even the best star war film ( i'd put it third , after the origin and the empir strike back ) . but it an excit and entertain film , far better than your typic summer blockbust . the film can't live up to it hype - no film , not even the origin star war , could have done that . but it still worth see . . . probabl more than onc .
1 now that " boogi night " has made disco respect again ( well , fashion at least ) , we shouldn't be surpris to see more film glorifi that dubious era . the latest art hous interpret is whit stillman " the last day of disco . " stillman , who made " metropolitan " and " barcelona " use some of the same actor , use disco final hour to highlight what is anoth conversation-heavi movi that benefit from typic astut write from the director . the young , upwardly-mobil profession ( don't call them yuppi ! ) men and women of " the last day of disco " frequent a prestigi new york citi nightclub pulsat to the bass-pound rhythm of earth wind and fire , ami grant , and andrea true connect . here they talk and talk and talk , intellectu about such thing as date , success , and be like , accept , and admir . if talk is cheap , " the last day of disco " must sure have been an extrem inexpens movi to shoot . what make the film so entertain is that this preppi , harvard-educ jet set actual have someth to say and say it with wit , percept , and style ( includ , at one point , a riotous invent deconstruct of " the ladi and the tramp " ) . na ? ve alic ( chlo ? sevigni ) and sophist charlott ( kate beckinsal ) are recent colleg graduat who work as assist editor for a new york publish hous . charlott is confid and outspoken--perhap a littl too outspoken ; alic is shi and introvert , " like a kindergarten teacher . " the two friend often doll themselv up and head out to the nameless nightspot , look good and look for excit ( and that ms . beckinsal sure look good on a dancefloor ! ) . here they meet , or re-meet , a varieti of elig men , mani of whom they knew in colleg . des ( play by stillman favorit christoph eigeman ) is one of the club manag whose job is on the line for sneak his ad agenc buddi in the back . des has reach a crisi point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he gay . whether it true or not , it make for a conveni excus to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennif beal in a small but soul-bar turn ) . charlott observ cattili that the onli gay thing about des is his mouth . jimmi ( mackenzi astin ) is the advertis exec who , by the end of the pictur , wind up head for a new job opportun in spain ( vision of " barcelona " ? ) . josh ( matt keeslar ) is an assist district attorney who dream of be abl to say , just onc , " book this clown ! " and robert sean leonard play anoth one of alic revolv suitor ; the two have an amus exchang about the true definit of virgin . ani film that can make robert sean leonard palat is worthi of respect in my book . in fact , the entir ensembl is appeal in that well-spoken stillman way . while the eschew of " feroci pair " is a favor topic of convers in the film , the protagonist tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and troubl with each other in an emot merry-go-round that clever develop it charact through the " prefer " dynam of social group interact . more matur than stillman previous two film , " the last day of disco " is as consist droll as it is stimul . it a movi you should definit get on down to .

" the blair witch project " was made with a budget of $1 . 75 and explod on the screen , rake in huge profit . the concept was brilliant . the filmmak creat a remark buzz that the stori might be real . the film itself was even more convinc . the movi _must_ be authent . whi els would such amateurish footag be on the big screen ? the first film caught lightn in a bottl . the sequel prove you can't pour that old lightn into a new bottl . you have to give this effort some credit . it would have been easi to have made the same movi again with a new group of kid . it would have been easi , but of cours , it wouldn't have work . instead " book of shadow " acknowledg the first film as a movi and concentr on the hysteria follow it releas . it a great scheme and possibl the onli entertain way to do a sequel . unfortun it doesn't work either . five kid spend the night in the wood at the scene of the first film . weird stuff happen and they retreat to an old factori where one of them live . even weirder stuff happen . some peopl die , there blood and knive and none of the charact have a lick of common sens . while suppos do serious research , the group set up a circl of surveil camera in the ruin of the old hous in the wood and vow to stay alert all night await a visit . then they proceed to get total trash on drug and alcohol and parti down with veri loud , veri obnoxi heavi metal music . it a bad plan . the cast show some earli promis . a coupl is do research on a " blair witch " book . the tour guid is a former mental patient turn ebay aficionado . a goth amazon princess add a bit of comed relief . the obligatori hot babe is the 2000 spiritu cinemat descend of the cute hippi chick , the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick : the cute wiccan chick . the first film unaccomplish actor came across as real peopl in a real situat becaus hour and hour of video were shot dure day in the wood . this time , these unaccomplish actor just come across as unaccomplish actor . there not one charact you care about when they start shout for no reason . although what pass for a plot start out with a solid idea , it ruin by poor execut . the follow-up to one of the most success horror film ever is noth more than a bad slasher movi . they'r trap in an old big weird hous . they stupid separ into various room . there are strang nois , they see scari apparit and peopl disappear . ever see this movi ? season documentari director joe berling should know better . the film featur most cheap trick and unnecessari gore . for a storylin fill with surpris , it odd predic .

1 airplan ! is consid among mani to be the epitom of satir film-mak . after all , it brought to us by one of the best known satir writing/direct team . even if most peopl don't recogn the name behind the film , they are bound to recogn the titl : airplan ! , top secret , the nake gun , and hot shot to name a few . but although the zucker/abrahams/zuck team was first introduc with the kentucki fri movi in 1977 , airplan ! remain the true cornerston of their work , and their directori debut . in the seventi , disast film seem to be at an all time high . film like earthquak , the tower inferno , and the poseidon adventur were big hit . there was also a seri about the disast that can aris when travel by plane - a seri that span the entir decad . and so , in 1980 , we were introduc to a new airplan disast film . this time the disast had noth to do with a maniac hijack or crash into the ocean . . . it had to do with bad fish . airplan ! is the stori of ted striker ( robert hay ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decis he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrad . unabl to stop live in the past , ted world fell apart . he spent his time move from citi to citi without ever have a stabl job , and eventu , as we begin this film , is get dump by his lover , flight attend elain dickinson ( juli hagerti ) . in a desper attempt not to lose her , ted buy a ticket for the same flight elain is work . unfortun , she is unsympathet and even critic ted for follow her , which leav him wallow in self-piti . in the midst of it all , someth happen . someon get sick . then anoth . then anoth . soon , the whole plane is full of deathly-il chicago-bound peopl . . . and when the pilot get sick ( play by peter grave , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmor ) , who will save the day ? ( gee , i wonder ) of cours the main draw here is the non-stop " whiz-bang " comedi , with a hefti dose of both visual and spoken gag . although i had seen this movi a few time befor , i was still laugh thru the entir thing . the most fun charact by far is the doctor , play by lesli nielsen . he a dri , subtl , sterotyp straight-fac doctor that end up say some of the funniest line of the film . in a film like this , you'r not realli expect an elabor product , so one can't complain about the amateurish qualiti . what you can complain about is the absolut annoy johnni , play by stephen stucker . this charact is pointless , nauseat , and veri unfunni . i don't know whi he was put in there , and i don't think anybodi will find a good excus . and when the film near an end , it slow down quit a bit , almost get old . you gotta give it to a movi that onli run 88 minut and can feel two hour long . asid from that , airplan ! is realli a top-notch spoof that will like forev be known as a spoof classic . it would be a good choic to pop in the vcr with a group of friend , especi if they haven't seen it . and if they ask what the plot is , just tell em " it a synopsi of the basic storylin of the film , but that not import right now . " if you'v seen the film , you'll understand ; - )

0 sylvest stallon has made some crap film in his lifetim , but this has got to be one of the worst . a total dull stori that think it can use various explos to make it interest , " the specialist " is about as excit as an episod of " dragnet , " and about as well act . even some attempt at film noir mood are destroy by a sappi script , stupid and unlik charact , and just plain nothing . who knew a big explos could be so bore and anti-climact ? unless you saw " blown away " . . . " the specliast " of the titl is none other than action star sylvest stallon ( in comeback #19 , i think ) , who play a quiet , hermit-lik bomber who was onc a bomb expert with the armi or someth , but who suffer a chang of heart when he and his assist ( jame wood , who show us exact what over-the-top is , other than anoth bad sli film ) accident kill some innoc peopl dure a job . his credo is kill bad peopl , not innoc . and that whi he make big bomb . so anyway , into his life step the seduct sharon stone , who is basic the girlfriend/mol of the stupid son ( eric robert ) of a cuban/miami kingpin ( rod steiger , in an indecipher accent , which is sometim cuban , sometim brando , sometim scottish , etc ) . turn out sharon is actual use her boyfriend so she can kill him , sinc he kill her parent when she was young . so she call sli , leav messag with him , send him e-mail , etc , about plant a bomb to kill robert , which sli listen to obsess , and while he work out nake . yea . also into his life , though again , come wood , who has been tip off by stone to catch sli . use the cop , he tri to set up trap , none which realli work , so when sli call him , he goe ballisit on his ass over the phone , get so work up by say his must-be-improvis speech that he seem to pop the vein in his head wide open . these are the most excit scene in the film , and wood becom the onli ounc of entertain in the film . the film tri to offer us a moodi film noir , except with explos , but come up complet snake-ey . it just a pretend film noir , make it a big wast of time . and for action buff , the action scene are pretti lame , with some realli unrealistic-look special effect ( a penthous be blown off of a hotel look like a piec of cardboard fall into a tub ) . then there the much-discuss sex scene between sli and stone , which are about as mispair a coupl as rachel and ross on " friend . " their sex scene is more nauseat then sexi , becaus it show us more of sli than stone . now let guess who we'd rather see nake , okay ? stone small but perki breast , which we'v seen more time than harvey keitel dick , or stallon veini ass , which isn't usual shown for a veri good reason ? i know i can't realli judg it as a flaw of the film , but come on . the worst flaw of the film is this : it bore . i mean , i was on caffein when watch it , but my friend fell asleep onli to be woken up by jame wood rant . but a good movi doe not jame wood go nut make . if you'r in for some fun action , rent sli earlier " demolit man , " which suck too , but in a much more entertain fashion . skip this dull film , unless you want to see wood , or make fun of steiger accent , or see stone breast again .
0 star william baldwin ; cindi crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the cast of supermodel cindi crawford in the lead role . not that cindi doe that bad , it just that anyon who watch this film know from moment one that that littl bit of cast was not done becaus of cindi extraordinari act skill , but for her extraordinari abil to look drop dead gorgeous in ani situat . and in fair game most situat tend to find cindi either soak wet or veri hot and sweati , but i'm sure that that is just a coincid , no doubt that these situat were essenti to the plot and the fact that cindi look great wet , well , that just a happi coincid . sure . william baldwin isn't a bad actor . unfortun , he just doesn't demonstr it at all in this movi . i'm not sure if that becaus most of his line were just so hokey , or if he was tri to make cindi act look good . if it was the latter , it work . cindi doe a surpris good job here in her first movi . which is not to say that she doesn't have room for improv . although to be fair to cindi , her line were kinda cheesi in place . so right about now you are no doubt ask yourself what sort of movi doe cindi crawford , arguabl the most beauti woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? well , i'm glad you ask that question . cindi play a lawyer who by some convolut plot twist becom a target for former elit kgb agent . whi woud they target someon as likabl as cindi , you ask ? by the end of the movi you won't care . the stori is so contriv it isn't funni . anyway after cindi get blown out of the window of her hous , without get so much as a scratch i might add , she is place into protect polic custodi under the watch eve of william baldwin . who charact , max kilpatr , a polic detect , seem to possess the skill of some sort of fight machin ( my guess is that the writer have seen way too mani of steven seagal earli film ) . the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin charact of the run from these killer russian isn't all that bad of an idea , it just everyth around that basic idea which kinda stink out loud . the support cast member are noth more that over act stereotyp . if i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappear . as for crawford , she may inde have some act abil . unfortun , ani she doe have is obscur by write that goe beyond bad . this movi was obvious written with cindi in mind , sinc the writer spend most of their time find way to capit off of her look . it too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , sinc ms . crawford is more than capabl of look just fine all by herself thank you veri much . unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movi that will onli disappoint you .
0 overblown remak of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( base on shirley jackson novel " the haunt of hill hous " ) star lili taylor as one of three " lab rat " that particip in a suppos " insomnia " studi be initi by liam neeson . he is actual conduct a studi on the caus of fear and whi the human mind is still affect by it . he drag the test subject out to a forebod mansion where all type of " creepi " cgi effect scare the cast and tri the audienc patienc . i know this question has been pose befor , but whi do peopl keep remak good movi ? the origin was a great psycholog horror film . this new version is dull and veri decid not scari . in fact , i feel it is downright imposs to make a modern day pg-13 horror movi that is scari . unless you find obvious comput generat special effect frighten , then there noth in this film that will rais hackl . i near fell asleep twice dure the film , and probabl would have if they guy two row behind me didn't seem to have such a person relationship with the charact that he felt he need to discuss everi decis they made with them as the film progress . it sad to see such an amaz cast wast so bad . owen wilson spend most of the film wander the hall of the hous , and the script doe no justic to his wonder comic abil . catherin zeta-jon ( alway nice to look at ) is given the woefulli underwritten role of a bi-sexu insomniac that get to run out of her bedroom perplex everi time some strang nois occur . liam neeson pop in from time to time to talk into his tape record and attempt to convinc the other that he has as much knowledg about what go on as the rest of them do . final , poor lili taylor , the center of the film , get the brunt of the cgi effect thrown at her while everyon els get to scream and tri to rescu her . appar , a subplot involv a tryst between zeta-jon and taylor charact was film but remov . that too bad , becaus it might have lent some better character to the narrat . this is jan de bont second straight misfir ( speed 2 : cruis control be the first ) . when is he go to learn that bigger is not alway necessarili better ? robert wise knew that when he made the origin and the make of the blair witch project also knew that . one should not approach a haunt hous movi with a twister mindset . if de bont and screenwrit david self had let our mind fill in the blank as to what was happen instead of show us everyth , it would have serv to make the film terrifi . what our mind fashion on it own can be a thousand time more frighten than have have it complet led toward everyth . appar , yet anoth version of this stori is be film under it origin titl . i certain hope that this newer rendit will not be hurt by the insan of jan de bont version and that it will retain the psycholog impact that the origin releas had .

0 for his director debut , gari oldman chose a high person famili drama about a violent , alcohol husband and father , and the various live he affect . but while the charact , place and event may have special mean to the writer-director , the audienc is left in the dark . the center of this tale is the abus raymond ( ray winston ) , and the film focus on him and the peopl who orbit around him . he spend his day hang out with his friend at pub and girli bar . then , he return home to his pregnant wife , valeri ( kathi burk ) and their five-year-old daughter . raymond demonstr his violent tendenc ( and his paranoid delus ) earli on when he accus valeri brother , billi ( charli creed-mil ) , of steal . raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloodi wreck . but these are the least of billi problem . billi is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn't seem that he'll last much longer . billi and valeri mother , janet ( laila mors ) , is raymond nemesi . she disapprov of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anyth about it . she mere struggl on , hope her children will surviv their respect torment . if this descript seem bleak , i haven't told the half of it . this is not a cheeri movi , and most of the time it downright depress . while at time it is interest to watch to see just what make raymond tick , and whi no one ever simpli call the cop on him , in the end , it not quit worth it . there are too mani scene which random dot the pictur with littl or no purpos . take for exampl the extend sequenc where one of billi scuzzi friend defend a stray puppi . the film is fill with these " charact moment " that never realli achiev anyth . grant , there are a few genuin power ( and sicken ) moment in the film , but their express seem to be more of a catharsi for the creator than us . the actor do a fine job , particular in the central role . the good thing about an actor turn writer is that oldman know how to write good scene , and the actor in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into . the bad thing about an actor turn director is that there no one to restrain oldman from make poor choic . a good charact drama should mean someth to those involv in make the film and the audienc . oldman got it about half right .
0 " tarzan and the lost citi " is one of the most anem movi to come out in quit a while . not onli it is poor written , bad act , and general incompet in all cinemat area , it is thorough uninspir and insipid . unfortun , it not bad in the way great , coloss misfir like " heaven gate " ( 1980 ) or " ishtar " ( 1987 ) were bad . instead , it liter drip off the screen like a movi nobodi want to be associ with , which beg the question of whi it was made in the first place . with all the good script lie around hollywood un-produc , how doe needless drek like this make it way to the big screen ? of cours , tarzan is one of the most film charact in all of motion pictur histori - he has appear in over forti film , which have rang from the veri good ( 1984 " greystok : the legend of tarzan , lord of the ape " ) down to the realli bad ( 1981 " tarzan , the ape man " with bo derek ) . most of these film were just cheapi b-movi made in the thirti and forti , star ex-olymp athlet and a lot of cutsi chimp . therefor , if anoth tarzan movi is to be made , one might assum that it would have someth new to offer - a differ angl , an origin storylin , anyth to set it apart from all the other . " greystok " ad a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpi tale , and even " tarzan , the ape man " at least had the mis-guid audac to sexual the stori as a vehicl for bo derek bare breast . " tarzan and the lost citi , " on the other hand , has absolut noth to offer but a bunch of recycl storylin and bad dialogu . the script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formula and generic as they come . comic book have better plot than this . the movi is so bad , in fact , that it retain that ridicul tarzan call that was so tireless mock in last summer comedi " georg of the jungl . " didn't the produc think to leav that back in the old weissmul pictur where it belong ? the stori start with the legend of tarzan alreadi firm establish : a quick open narrat tell of tarzan ( casper van dien ) be found in the jungl after have been rais by ape , and his return to england where he assum his greystok heritag . when the movi start in 1913 , he is a civil english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marri jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . howev , when a wick archeologist/grave-robb name nigel raven ( steve waddington ) begin hunt for the fabl lost citi of opar , one of africa last great secret , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summon tarzan back to the jungl . at first , jane refus to go , pout about how it will interfer with their wed ; but after tarzan leav she chang her mind and track him down , therefor assur lot of lame smooch scene between her and her ape-man . onc the film get go ( in it own sluggish way ) , it delv into a seri of jungl adventur , as tarzan , jane , and the nativ attempt the thwart raven and his crew from discov the citi . most of the so-cal adventur are cheesi , predict , and unexcit , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . there are sequenc stolen from innumer recent adventur movi , rang from " raider of the lost ark " ( 1981 ) to " the gooni " ( 1985 ) . when the movi is run short on action , it includ a few greenpeace-friend scene of tarzan free cage anim , releas a babi eleph from a trap , and throw ivori tusk into the river . the movi is also lack even a remot hint of realiti . for instanc , when tarzan - who was rais in the jungl - is bit by a cobra , he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like ani semi-experienc weekend backpack would do . instead , he tie a tourniquet around his arm and stumbl off into the jungl with no plan for surviv . of cours , one can't help but notic how fundament mislead the titl is . not to ruin the end or anyth , but there is no lost citi . there is , howev , a lost pyramid , which i suppos is all the resource-strap fx depart could come up with ( the special effect are not worthi of a made-for-tv movi ) . which also bring up the question of whi the treasur hunter had to slog through numer underground cavern to get to the lost pyramid , when it sit right out in the middl of an open field ? strict speak , " tarzan and the lost citi " isn't even bad enough to have camp qualiti , although casper van dien laughabl stiff perform come real close . this movi prove what " starship trooper " onli hint at : he cannot act , but he sure look well-groom , even in the deepest heart of the african jungl . van dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effect tarzan ; he a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . i also wonder what the make-up depart was think when it outfit him with that aw circa-1983 steve perri haircut . waddington make a decent villain , although he like a charmless version of belloq from " raider of the lost ark . " as jane , the ex-model jane march has littl to do but smile and look pretti next to tarzan . she doe fire off a gun at the evil treasur hunter a time or two , but whenev a snake come into the pictur , she is reduc to a hyster mess . howev , amidst all this complain , i do have one piec of good news . " tarzan and the lost citi " is so lack in idea both new and old , that it is unabl to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . so , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decenc to be short .
1 scream 2 , like it predecessor , is a genre-cross film . it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mysteri . the mix work veri well last time and it continu to entertain this time . scream was also known for it self-referenti tone . mani insid joke were made in refer to horror movi and wes craven . again , scream 2 follow suit with charact say such thing as " sequel suck " and " the entir horror genr was destroy by sequel . " scream 2 stori is veri similar to it predecessor . sidney ( neve campbel ) , have surviv the kill spree in scream , is now in colleg . gale weather ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murder and that book is now be releas as a featur film , call stab ( which for all practic purpos is the real-world movi scream ) . at the premier of stab , two student from sidney colleg are stab to death , and a new stori begin . the press descend on sidney and her colleg to get the scoop on this sequel killer . they want to know all about the link between stab , sidney , and the recent murder . the most complex self-refer i saw ( this should be an olymp event ) was the scene where gale weather was ask question at a press confer . the rest of the press was watch and videotap weather . the other survivor from scream were watch and videotap the press . the audienc was watch the whole , film scene . ( whew . ) the movi is pack with layer and self-refer that make it a pleasur to watch . even better would be to watch a doubl featur of scream and scream 2 . that not to say that these refer necessarili make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movi . the just add to the fun of watch it . i recommend it for other reason as well . what i like best about the horror aspect of the movi is that the monster is not supernatur . no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is respons . it is a person in a mask and a robe , his onli advantag the fear he strike into his victim . no extraordinari leap of faith is need to believ in the killer . the down side is that if you are frighten by horror movi , you have less ground to say " it just a movi . " the whodunit aspect of the movi is not that great by itself - gale weather and deputi dewey ( david arquett , also from the origin ) track down a killer . they are likeabl , but not outstand . but in combin with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint . it was exact a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream . the internet movi databas say that scream 3 is in the work , so i wonder if i'll be do the same thing on januari 1 , 1999 . if craven and screenwrit kevin williamson are abl to keep the qualiti high , i'll be happi to mark my calendar .
0 the first speci was a moderately-success scienc fiction yarn that divert audienc with some nifti special effect , a few well- pace action sequenc , and frequent view of model-turned-actress natasha henstridg san cloth . howev , it was definit not a movi that cri out for a sequel . and , consid the qualiti of speci 2 , it obvious that mgm should have stop while they were ahead . the onli thing that distinguish speci 2 is how aw it is . if you throw away the plot , which is character by a blatant disregard for intellig , logic , coher , and consist , speci 2 actual has a few thing to recommend it to a select audienc . of cours , that audienc is primarili compris of teenag boy ( who , at least in theori , shouldn't be abl to get into an " r " -rate film ) and connoisseur of bad movi . there enough blood , gore , simul sex , and bare flesh in speci 2 to prevent it from ever becom bore . this is a grade z exploit flick that ripe for the mysteri scienc theater 3000 treatment . somewher , someplac , i recal hear speci 2 describ as " erot . " i would love to know who use with that adject for this movi , becaus he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of erotic . sure , there a lot of sex and nuditi , but it almost alway accompani by the rip open of a woman abdomen as an alien babi claw it way free , splatter blood and gore in all direct . anyon turn on by that is not someon i would care to be sit next to in a theater . i suppos the main attract in speci 2 is natasha henstridg ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she doe remov her top , but onli onc , and onli briefli ) . although the charact she play in the origin speci is dead , govern scientist still have the dna , and , out of what can onli be describ as a suicid impuls , they decid to creat anoth clone . this creatur , dub " eve " by it creator , dr . laura baker ( play by marg helgenberg , repris her role ) , is genet engin to be kinder and more docil . meanwhil , man has final set foot on mar . a team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has travel to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring someth with them . ross has becom a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he soon mate like crazi , collect the blood-soak children that are the result of each sex session . his intent is obvious world domin . stand in his way is that indomit soldier of fortun from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick fellow astronaut , denni gambl ( mykelti williamson ) . but when patrick learn about eve , a femal of his kind , there no damp his ardor . i'm not sure what the budget for speci 2 was , but a signific portion of it must have gone into pay handsom salari to sever recogniz actor ( as oppos to be divert into the special effect ) . michael madsen and marg helgenberg , both back for a second round , are clear on hand to do as littl as they can , grab the money , and run . ditto for jame cromwel , who play patrick father -- " underus " is too kind a word to describ his involv ( " invis " would be more like it ) . georg dzundza get to do a littl scenery- chew as an angry-but-inept general . meanwhil , justin lazard perform as patrick is so flat that he make natasha henstridg limit abil look good by comparison . the onli one in the whole product with ani energi is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecrack black sidekick . complet with cheesi special effect , bare breast around everi narrat corner , and dialogu capabl of produc howl of laughter , speci 2 has been dump into the marketplac without advanc screen for critic . director peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a signific list of mediocr movi on his resum , has ad anoth forgett titl , but at least he appear to have had fun do it , which is more than can be said of anyon tri to take this film with even a scintilla of serious . do i recommend the movi ? absolut not , but i will admit that speci 2 is dopey enough that it didn't tri my patienc to the degre that some pseudo-intellectu bad movi do . here hope there no speci 3 .
1 tree loung is the director debut from one of my favorit actor , steve buscemi . he gave memor perform in in the soup , fargo , and reservoir dog . now he tri his hand at write , direct and act all in the same flick . the movi start out aw slow with tommi ( buscemi ) hang around a local bar the " tree loung " and him pester his brother . it obvious he a loser . but as he say " it better i'm a loser and know i am , then be a loser and not think i am .

1 upon take a seat at the theater , and survey the crowd , i soon realiz that i was the onli person under forti in the premis . i'm twenty-two , but have been accus of look sixteen . yet as the film began , ani conscious of set shift to the home of five close-knit , yet troubl sister . director pat o'connor ( invent the abbot , circl of friend ) weav a quiet yet affect tale of loss , need , and the bond between five sister . the famili is rule by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsci strict schoolteach , who is complet conscious of the deterior of her famili . there is veri littl background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tens but love home . squabbl take place one after the other , caus by year and year of histori . perhap one of the best thing about this film , is it natur . no situat is over-wrought , and charact react as real peopl do , to real problem . this probabl is a result of the film be from a stage play . the play was in turn is base on a time in the life of the playwright . what seem to be an under theme are the pagan ritual and danc of peopl , both in lughnasa and africa . in fact , danc seem to be the glue that hold the famili togeth and most express show their close . leg tap , and bodi sway even in the midst of impend disast . onli after the music stop , and the charact stand breath heavili do we sens ani troubl . in the quiet after the music we muse that it sad that music has to ceas , and famili falter . the movi is frame by a scene of michael mundi , the narrat of the movi , as a young child fli a kite . he trip over a bump and lose hold of his string , and the kite float off farther into the distanc . drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that look at onc pain , and at anoth glanc mischiev . the mundi famili itself follow a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate hold of the famili isn't strong enough to hold off the wind of chang . as michael stand , stare at his kite fli away , we hear the adult michael , look back at the season that his world chang forev . the movi is not overpow , but it give us a beauti window into the life , love , and troubl of a household of lone women . note : this is the first movi review i'v ever written , ani respons on it would be great appreci . : )
1 tibet has enter the american conscious slowli dure the past few year and burst into the forefront recent . the dalai lama has made speak tour , tibetan design and artifact are show up in shop , the plight of the peopl has captur the imagin of major actor and artist and now there are two big budget film within as mani month . " kundun " ( " presenc " , a name the monk call the young dalai lama ) open in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarn of the tibetan leader . a group of monk enter a villag and a two-year-old child catch their attent . the young boy prove himself by identifi possess of the previous holi man as " mine " . he and his famili are then move to a monasteri in lhassa where he is to be prepar to take his posit as the religi and polit leader of the countri . he is forc into difficult decis when china invad the countri in 1950 . the peac and isol countri is ill-equip to fight off the intrud and diplomat attempt over the next year yield no result . eventu he must make the pain choic to flee to neighbor india . comparison to " seven year in tibet " are inevit . both film cover much of the same ground although the earlier movi doe so from a western point of view and featur boxoffic draw brad pitt . " kundun " featur onli nativ actor and is more of an insid stori . in some way , this make this film a superior concept , but it lack the movement and spark that made " seven year " such an audience-pleas . the actor contribut to the realist feel of the movi ( film in morocco for obvious reason ) . the onli disappoint is chairman mao who look like a wax dummi and move as if he were a computer-gener charact . on an intellectu level , it is interest to see how two differ approach handl the same fact . some event are depict differ and pitt austrian mountain-climb who was portray as a pivot influenc in the dalai lama life isn't even mention here . gloss over in " seven year " , the problem with the tibetan polit system is hint at here as the dalai lama muse " we were just about to chang thing " after the chines attack . the film is magnific beauti thank primarili to the cinematographi of roger deakin . his linger camera show the exot tibetan cultur with luscious detail . especi strike is an extrem move close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . the visual treat more than make up for the movi fault creat a poetic medit for the audienc . walk out of the theater you feel like you have awaken from a transcendent experi . martin scorses , known for his dark tale of the underworld ( " goodfella " , " taxi driver " , " casino " ) has shift gear . someth of a themat follow-up to his " the last temptat of christ " , this is his slowest film yet . odd enough for a director with a histori of graphic violenc present a histori fill with atroc by the chines , most of these event take place off-screen . his decis to not over-explain ritual is commend . the stumbl oracl who spit out his propheci while in a tranc state is much more effect as a mysteri than if we were spoon-f interpret . philip glass score is impress although at time it is too overwhelm and distract . i talk to a tibetan i met outsid the theater who had just seen the film and was walk back in to see it again . hear his descript of how he escap from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldier accompani the dalai lama dure his trip to india , i was struck by what was miss in the movi . as grand as it look and as histor accur as it is , there is a distanc between the audienc and the movi . the film is more concern with visual and histori and less so with human be . with the except of a few scene , involv with the charact is slight . one of those except is the portray of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischiev boy who can't resist be a kid sometim . an encount with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retir indiana univers professor ) who tell the young leader the chines have order him to persuad him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstand moment , but there aren't mani of these . even with it problem , the " kundun " experi is phenomen , but one that i fear most will miss . mani peopl who saw " seven year in tibet " will have a " been there , done that " attitud . it like that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public respons will be the sound of one hand clap .
1 buffalo ? 66 is a veri rare known movi that star vincent gallo and christina ricci . gallo play a veri troubl man , who was sent to jail for gambl . onc out of jail , he must visit his parent , who he told he was marri . the truth is he isn't marri . to tri to impress them , he kidnap a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap danc class to act as his wife . the film is veri cheapli made , and it show it throughout a lot of the movi , but you don't need money to make a good film . buffalo ? 66 doesn't alway stay with the realist concept , and sometim goe through outrag event . gallo parent , play by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two veri strang individu . the mother play a footbal fanat and the father play a quiet man with odd habit . gallo and ricci arriv at his parent hous , and some extrem funni scene take place within the hous . ricci perform dure the scene at gallo parent home are veri well done . there is constant humor involv in the interest dinner tabl scene . the way the movi was film in this particular part of the movi were interest and creativ . they seem veri mediocr , but they work out just fine . gallo charact is develop veri well . the impress that he is veri depress and confus is veri clear . gallo give a perform that make you believ what the charact is go through . his charact goe through mani , mani problem , just like mani peopl in real life . this charact seem veri realist to me . ricci charact is funni and differ . she doesn't care much that she has been kidnap , in fact , she fall in love the man who kidnap her ! ricci is a veri wonder actress and she is start to get the recognit that she deserv . buffalo ? 66 isn't all laugh though . mani scene are veri dramat and depress . gallo charact was so realist , he was extrem disturb . some scene are suppos to come off as funni , but they actual seem sad and real to life . the film sometim drag along , not give much materi . i realli would have like to see gallo parent a lot more , and i would have like to see the charact develop more . overal , buffalo ? 66 isn't as good as some peopl put it up to be . the bottom line- a few hyster scene save this film from sink to the bottom .
0 ok , i admit it--i find camp amus with the spice girl . yes , the same spice girl of the gimmicki individu " ident , " they of the annoy infecti bubblegum pop hook and cheesi unifi mantra of " girl power . " but not even their guilti pleasur appeal isn't enough to carri their big screen debut , a junki mess which would be more apt name shite world than spice world . the film begin amus enough , with a cheeki 007-esqu titl sequenc in which the british quintet-- " scari " ( melani brown ) , " babi " ( emma bunton ) , " sporti " ( melani chisolm ) , " ginger " ( geri halliwel ) , and " posh " ( victoria adam ) --are introduc one by one ( to , much to my surpris , excit and onli slight mock cheer from the press audienc ) as they croon the silki ballad " too much " ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual jame bond film ) . a few minut and an elton john cameo later come an introductori tour of the numer plotlin that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spici one go on a european public tour lead up to their first live concert at london royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film produc ( georg wendt ) and a screenwrit ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film idea to the girl manag , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentari film crew follow the girl ; ( 4 ) a pregnant " mate " ( naoki mori ) of the group rapid approach her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publish ( barri humphri ) attempt to destroy the group with the help of a sneaki shutterbug ( richard o'brien ) . cap off by a live rendit of the girl bounci hit " say you'll be there , " a wealth of laugh and merriment is sure to follow , right ? wrong . it all downhil from there as spice world collaps into a seri of misfir comedi sketch . i must give the girl credit for their refresh willing to make fun of themselv , but writer kim fuller and director bob spier can bare come up with a funni joke between them , much less a organ framework for all the " wacki " goings-on . spice world jump from vignett to vignett , subplot to subplot with no direct and littl sens , at one minut have the girl meet with alien ( no joke ) and at anoth have them stage a dare rescu of two young fan who fall into the water dure a boat ride . while a decent joke slip through the crack here and there--dur a " danc bootcamp " scene , the girl sing the lyric " we know how we got this far/strength and courag and a wonderbra " --much of the materi is not even funni on the chuckl level . some gag are just plain pointless , such as roger moor recur role as the mysteri chief , who dispens cryptic , metaphor-heavi advic to clifford . the onli reason whi i can think anyon would find that funni is the fact that moor onc play jame bond . ha ha . as weak as the script is , i think there one insurmount problem with even attempt to make a spice girl movi , and that is the girl themselv . the point is not that they can't act ( and , for the record , they realli _can't_ ) but that their individu persona , which work as a gimmick over the span of a four-minut music video , are too thin to surviv outsid of the truncat , video bite mtv world . posh ( who garner the most enthusiast cheer dure the introduct ) come off best by default becaus her persona ( rich bitch ) most easili translat into charact in a film . babi persona ( young innoc ) , to a lesser extent , also work , but the remain girl ident are a littl harder to flesh out . there realli isn't much to do with sporti besid have her exercis everi so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spier do ) , and , after all , what exact entail be " ginger " or " scari " ? appar , just their wardrob . spice world manag to pick up some steam in the late go follow a flashback perform of the spice signatur hit , " wannab . " the song is as grate as ever , but the energi of the number give the proceed a much-need shot in the arm , set the stage for a wave of self-referenti humor stem from the screenwrit film idea ( the film almost mirror robert altman the player in the way the film snail into itself ) . this section of the film , involv all manner of derring-do involv a speed bus , is perhap it most effect , but it also point up how all the other storylin ( the publish , the documentari crew ) lack a satisfactori payoff . spice world is harmless entertain suitabl for the entir famili , and it will pleas the spice faith . but this sloppi enterpris sure won't win them ani new fan , which is what the group sore need to bolster it rapid wane girl power in the state . onc the hype disappear , spice world will like serv as the the spice final hurrah in america .
1 in zooland , the world most success , influenti and intellectually-challeng male model derek zooland wonder , " is there more to life than be realli realli realli good look ? " obvious , the film creator and star ben stiller ask a similar question when craft a feature-length movi out of his hilari vh1/vogu fashion award short-film subject : can there be more to this film than be realli realli realli silli ? no , of cours not , and it never aspir to be anyth more . much like derek , zooland is a sweet simpleton of a movi . it not complex in either it social commentari or it comedi , and it never produc ani gut-bust laugh ( except mayb a scene when derek model roommat all die in a tragic " gasolin fight " accid -- a riotous funni take-off of tommi hilfig ad ) . but it has a satisfi hand of strong chuckl , wild charact and perform , and mild harsh potshot at the fashion industri to keep you amus . better yet , this exagger version of the origin three-minut skit is onli blown out to an effici 95 minut -- just enough time to string togeth it goofbal plot without exhaust the gag . zooland open with sever fashion bigwig plot to assassin the prime minist of malaysia , sinc he want to abolish child labor in his countri and thus drive up their cost . fashion design and crimin mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrel ) draft a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carri out the evil deed . enter derek , whose career is slump as newcom hansel ( owen wilson ) take the spotlight . on the trail of mugatu plot is time magazin report matilda jeffri ( stiller real-lif wife christin taylor ) , and she hope to use mugatu pawn derek to ultim foil the scheme . much like the austin power film , zooland reli heavili on the strength of the talent involv , and this zani comedi featur some of the funniest peopl in entertain today . wilson is hyster as the young , vain hansel . ferrel near steal the show from everyon as the flamboy , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstag everyon in austin power . jerri stiller -- ben dad who best rememb as frank costanza of seinfeld -- make a priceless turn as derek slimi agent mauri ballstein . even ben stiller show alum andi dick show up as a derang , large-ass masseus . as for ben stiller , it seem his derek has one gag : he stupid , which play out in some uproari one-lin . unfortun , taylor seem out of place and out of her leagu here . mayb it just becaus i can't stop see her as marcia bradi ( who she play in both bradi movi ) , make her unbeliev as a dowdi , braini plain jane who hasn't had sex in two year . she leav me pine for the cynic of janean garofolo , who would'v ad real comic substanc to the flimsi role . while zooland is hard highbrow , it screwbal humor is welcom dure these tri time , especi consid the gross lack of decent pick in the theater these day . zooland no masterpiec , but a veri worthi distract .
1 the coen brother are back again , this time with homer " odyssey " as the backdrop in their tale of three fugit from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasur in " o brother , where art thou ? " right for the begin of " o brother " the coen grab your attent with a chain gang of prison inmat break rock along the road in unison to a work song . the camera flow around the hard toil men , give a visual excit symmetri to the scene that end with our three hero - ulyss everett mcgill ( georg clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escap across a cotton field . it is the begin of a journey that take on differ mean and urgenc to each member of the trio . a strong suit , as alway with the coen brother , is the depth of charact of the folk they creat in their film . their charact are goofi and comic , like nicola cage in " rais arizona " ; or , dramat , as albert finney and john turturro in " miller cross " ; and , even a mix of the two with franc mcdormand in " fargo . " in all case , and in " o brother , " too , the charact popul their film are three-dimension peopl . ulyss everett is a handsom , hair-obsess petti crimin with a silver tongu and not a lot in the brain depart . but , he seem like a genius when compar to the simpl , sweet delmar and the maladjust pete , who follow their self appoint leader to a promis treasur of $1 . 2 million . their odyssey take on the mystic proport of homer origin materi as they meet all manner of peopl along the way , includ those danger siren who beckon them onto symbol rocki shoal and a cyclop who beat them and take all their money . there is magic , too , when delmar believ that pete was turn into a horni toad by the siren . the stori meander through the differ vignett of the boy adventur , give the flick a choppi , episod feel that disrupt the overal flow . some of the interlud are an epiphani , though . the trio becom a quartet when they pick up guitar-play tommi johnson ( chris thoma king ) and visit a radio station in the middl of nowher , run by it blind owner ( stephen root ) . they becom the soggi bottom boy for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledg , are record as they sing the tradit tune , " i am a man of constant sorrow . " it is a wonder moment of moviemak and give us , in my mind , the best movi song of the year . contrast this and other wonder moment ( the sexi seduct by the siren come to mind ) are some pretenti bit that detract from the overal qualiti of " o brother . " in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulyss , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan ralli to save tommi from be lynch . the scene is overblown and flashi and reek of " the wizard of oz . " they don't say " lion and tiger and bear , oh my ! " and there no dorothi , but it is the land of oz we'r see here . the high and low of the stori flow are temper by fine act on sever level . georg clooney is funni , charm , a littl dumb and one of the handsomest actor in the busi today . he has the charm of a 30 movi idol and is abl to put himself into silli situat with digniti . ulyss has an ongo obsess with his hair , risk life and limb to get a particular brand of pomad and a suppli of hairnet . his vaniti will come to plagu him as it would ani mystic hero-wander . while clooney is the name draw for " o brother , " the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar . the heretofor unknown nelson is terrif as the simpl convict who , at one point , hear the word of the lord and join member of a church congreg in their mass baptism . delmar is save and dedic his life to do good and provid a rich to his simpl charact that make him shine . the taciturn pete , as play by longtim coen collabor turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and give them the necessari angst . all togeth , the tune triumvir is a mix of the three stoog and the three musket as they prove to be buffoon , albeit brave one . the color support cast is rampant with homerian charact to meet and get to know along the way of the boy odyssey . charl durn appear as incumb governor pappi o'daniel , who keep cross path with them in his bid for re-elect . john goodman is wick as the one-ey bibl salesman and con artist , big dan teagu . michael badalucco is manic and outrag as outlaw and bank robber extraordinari , georg " babyfac " nelson . stephen root is amus as the blind dj , rep' one of the mani refer to the sightless that abound in the film in mystic way . holli hunter is wast in the small role as ulyss estrang wife , penni ( and the real reason for this adventur , not secret treasur ) . tech are , as expect in a coen brother ventur , first class . cinematograph roger deakin , who has work on five previous coen film , captur the sultri atmospher of the south . the photographi complement the lush period product and costum provid by denni gassner and mari zophr , respect . onc again , roderick jayn - the alter ego of ethan and joel coen - is on board as editor . the high point outweigh the low through most of " o brother , where art thou ? " with particular prais for the wonder select of period and tradit music . i give it a b .
1 my summer was recent save by two veri differ movi . on open night , i saw american pie 2 and laugh like a moron . then a few night later , i watch and thorough enjoy joel hershman greenfing even though it didn't featur a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott . howev , i felt just as good leav american pie 2 as i did after leav greenfing , which tell the offbeat tale of british murder colin brigg ( clive owen of croupier ) . after spend rough half of his life behind bar , he is transfer to a more lenient facil , edgefield . the picaresqu , rustic prison allow it inmat to learn a trade , while enjoy accommod general found at most colleg . at first , brigg doesn't want to be there . he use to live as a prison and want to be left alon . howev , his ail roommat , fergus ( david kelli of wake ned devin ) , wear brigg down through his benign natur . the two becom friend , with fergus give colin a packet of violet seed as a christma gift . brigg is astonish when the violet grow in the limeston soil , and begin a fight with three other prison when an errant soccer ball smash his belov flower . after the prison governor ( warren clark ) reprimand them , he awe at what brigg has accomplish . and he struck by an idea -- brigg , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison ground . greenfing , which is " inspir by actual event , " becom a bit like a sport movi after that . despit their differ , the men come togeth and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigi garden show . one renegad , in this case , brigg , will prove to have talent . of cours , love will also rear it head ( no , not " prison love " ) . to hershman credit , he doesn't pump up the drama or tri for cheap laugh , like last year lame marijuana comedi save grace . i had to keep pinch myself when i didn't see a singl scene of a harden con sneez over a pot of pansi , or the men give high-fiv over a particular stun batch of wildflow . the movi deal with peopl and score on that concept . it wonder see brigg turn from a bitter prison to a man who care again . give credit to owen for keep his cool in a part that beg for overact . his speech to the parol board about be reborn through garden is the best scene of it kind sinc morgan freeman last stand in the shawshank redempt . owen bedsid scene with kelli , who lend the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emot grip without be sappi . written by hershman , greenfing contain plenti of laugh . most come courtesi of helen mirren , who shine as the world-class garden who work with the inmat but fear for her daughter primros ( natasha littl ) when she start date brigg . the mother can't believ what he'll do if her daughter " burn the sunday roast . " noth is forc in greenfing . the funni line come forth natur in convers and not from punch line . primros and brigg relationship take awkward step . even when brigg decid to go back to edgefield , it done for reason of loyalti , not becaus the movi requir him to do so . after grimac through the forc screwbal antic of movi like america sweetheart and the princess dairi , it an almost indescrib pleasur to see a director take his time to tell a stori veri well .
1 the soldier of three king have taken their cue from movi about vietnam .

( there alreadi enough cynic in the film mention of kuwait oil-infest water . ) russel offer the mass a primer on the oft-dismiss gulf conflict , and pull off a neat trick : a war tale full of battl that take place after a truce has been declar . if he set out to make someth socially/culturally/politically/glob signific , he succeed . with flair .
0 it a shame the execut of this concept fall veri short of it premis . the movi is lack and most unsatisfi . osmosi jone is crude , gross , disgust , and was direct by the farrelli brother - the twist sibl behind there someth about mari , me , myself and iren and a coupl of other movi in which the humor is most target below the belt . not that there anyth wrong with scatolog . i bet even cavemen appreci bathroom humor - such as it was . it mere that with osmosi jone , the farrelli humor is too juvenil , too predict . you can almost forese the pun just by view the part of the inner anatomi a sequenc is drawn . osmosi jone look like one of those old health class movi gone psycho . the troubl is , the anim may pleas the veri young , but the joke may be over their head , while the teen-ag audienc may find it too tame for their tast . adult ? well , let just say most will find it unappet . osmosi jone play like a 100-minut infomerci for the eat healthi food lobbi . the live action sequenc revolv around frank ( bill murray ) , who seem to be the grungiest human be in the univers . he continu look as if he need a shave and a shower . frank , much to the constern of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eat anyth - and everyth - that can kill you . he work at a zoo where the anim look cleaner - and presum smell better - than he doe . frank bodi is invad by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eat a hard-boil egg that had fallen to the ground . it not gross enough that frank pick the egg up from the dirt and plop it into his mouth . nope , the farrelli pile it on by first have frank wrestl a chimp for the egg , wrest it from the primat mouth . like i said , the gross meter tip the scale on this one . after ingest the egg , the movi begin it anim sequenc . here , osmosi jone ( voic by chris rock ) , a renegad white blood cell is team with drix ( voic by frasier david hyde pierc ) , a 12-hour , painkil cold capsul to battl thrax ( smooth voic by laurenc fishburn ) . basic , what we have is a clich cop-buddi movi , rife with all the clich ? s of that genr . and this is whi osmosi jone doesn't click . it mere fall back on tire , familiar convent instead of creat new and excit situat . the joke and pun are lame : osmosi search out a snitch , a former flu virus . after pump him for inform , drix tell osmosi , " funni , he doesn't look fluish . " and the joke don't rise abov that level . the live action scene are no better . frank is such a slob , so unapp that it is difficult to fathom how he ever marri or even sire a child . he almost a bigger cartoon than the anim charact . osmosi jone is a movi that may be too violent for young children as thrax burn and dissolv blood cell right and left . the anim is rather two-dimension and flat . it lack scope and depth . it is an unapp movi that will leav you scratch your head , and mayb lean toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .
0 well there goe anoth one . sad this like other movi this year wasn't good . this one be almost as bad as the omega code but not quit . from the open credit i had a good feel this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . with bad excus for act , a horribl screenplay and straight-out bad direct the bachelor is a terribl unfunni movi that doesn't work on ani level accept that fact that rene zellwegar who doe give a good perform . the two cameo by brook shield and mariah carey are also good with brook be the best . the movi is troubl from the start becaus chris o'donnel is huge miscast and give one of the worst perform to date . here is the stupid plot : chris o'donnel play jimmi shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meet ann ( rene zellwegar ) they instant hit it off and are togeth for three year . jimmi decid that he want to bring their relationship a littl bit up . he realli doesn't realiz that ann think he want to marri her ( what he want i never did catch ) . so he propos in a realli bad way , and she shoot him down and is veri mad . he of cours tri to apolog but noth seem to help ani . then his grandfath die and he learn that he has left jimmi 100 million dollar . . . . as long as he marri befor the next day at 6 : 05 pm . now jimmi must find ann and tri to marri her to get the money and becaus he love her , or get marri to someon els to get the money itself , lead to an un-funni and predict end that leav a bad tast in our mouth . ok so mayb this could be one of the dumbest , clich , silliest romant comedi to date that has no real big laugh . even the support role of arti lang , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good . the plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minut and by a five year old . the choppi dialogu and bad direct don't help thing ani . even though chris o'donnel gave an ok perform in the two batman movi , he doe not give even a remot good or funni perform here and i want to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . rene zelweggar is a differ stori and gave a charm , sweet and likabl perform ( as usual ) and realli was the onli thing that save this confus movi from be a total huge washout . her sister play by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistri onscreen . brook shield show up in a funni littl perform as a big-head mogul who after a while becam routin and old . one realli can't help but think that we have seen this stuff befor . it not like this is an origin idea and in the end , everyon know what is go to happen due do it clich and typic . the bachelor work on no good level and in fact doesn't work at all . ed anser and hal holbrook were wast in terribl role and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the onli film of her movi career dispit her terrif music career . chris o'donnel is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not say a great deal . he seem held back and realli doesn't get into his charact much and after even the first 30 minut get annoy and old . arti lang just to me seem like he is tri to anoth chris farley and was complet unfunni and un-nerv . whi the filmmak would want to wast such a cast in such a bad movi , with such bad act and dialogu is a question onli they will know . mayb they thought it would becom a hit or a critic success , and sometim i don't agre with other critic on movi , even from the trailer for this film they made it look bad and show all the mild funni part . it base on the 1925 silent film seven chanc which i am sure is veri better than this mess . even though some may think of this as a good date movi , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . besid be a terribl movi , the bachelor is well a terribl movi . it has noth worth recommend therefor i realli can't recommend this movi . i did not have a good time and i laugh onli three time . the run time of the movi is 106 minut which is wayyyi over time and need to be shorten at least thirti minut . part of it seem to go on forev and part of seem to not last enough time . be one of the worst movi of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymor stupid unfunni romant comedi , and if they do they i give up on filmmak .

0 the best thing about , " lake placid " is that it onli 80 minut long and when it over you'r glad that you didn't wast more than an hour and a half of your time . it noth more than a bad rip-off of , " jaw " ( and i think that be kind . ) it was written by david e . kelli ( " alli mcbeal " ) as a horror-comedi but fail at both , miser . i was never scare and i think that i onli laugh onc . the crocodil even fail in comparison to the snake in , " anaconda .

0 there was a time when john carpent was a great horror director . of cours , his best film was 1978 masterpiec , " halloween , " but he also made 1980 " the fog , " and 1987 underr , " princ of dark . " heck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with " in the mouth of mad . " but someth terribl wrong happen to him in 1992 , with the terribl comedi , " memoir of an invis man . " somehow , carpent has lost his touch , with junk like his fail 1995 remak of , " villag of the damn , " to his uninspir 1996 sequel , " escap from l . a . " those movi , howev , look like cinemat work of art compar to his latest film , " john carpent vampir . " if i was him , i defin wouldn't want to put my own name in the titl . it is a sad state of affair when carpent can make someth as misguid and flat written and film as , " vampir . " the stori is simpl . jack crow ( jame wood ) is a vampir hunter who , along with one of his partner , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitut , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , surviv an attack from the master vampir , valek ( thoma ian griffith ) . sinc katrina was previous bitten by him , crow take her along becaus anyon who is bitten by valek becom telepath link to him until they themselv turn into vampir a coupl day later , and crow is hope to find him with the help of her . it seem valek mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman cathol church that will enabl him to becom so power that sunlight will not destroy him . my question is : how mani time have we seen this same stori play out ? well , the answer is just about as mani time as a better version of the stori has been made . " john carpent vampir , " sad enough , is one of the most unscari horror film i'v ever seen . in fact , there isn't even one suspens moment in the whole 105-minut run time . the non-stop vampir attack sequenc are styleless film , without ani interest camera work , which is usual a trademark of carpent . and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is near non-exist . there is no stori develop , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the charact . jame wood can be a good actor , but he has noth to do here but to say a coupl of " pseudo " -clever line of dialogu . daniel baldwin has some potenti , but his charact come off as be veri dens . and sheryl lee ( fare much better as laura palmer in " twin peak " ) , like all of the femal charact , play an offens stereotyp whore . there is not an ounc of intellig , or excit in , " john carpent vamir , " which is veri dishearten come from an ex-fan of carpent . he has said that he turn down direct , " halloween : h20 , " becaus he couldn't work up ani excit for it . and yet , when ask about a " vampir " sequel , he said he would be happi to do it . i think that a definit sign that carpent has final lost ani trace of his last talent , not to mention a signific number of iq point .
1 martin scorses film use to intimid me . becaus of his reput , i felt oblig to appreci them as deep film art rather than as great flick . as much as i enjoy them , i usual felt like i miss someth . i learn from scorses casino that whatev techniqu he use are mere there to enhanc the stori . no mystic interpret is requir to appreci his movi . for exampl , in casino he use subtitl when robert deniro and joe pesci are use code word with each other . there was no mean more exot than that subtitl were the most succinct way for him to tell the audienc what was realli go on . or toward the end , when he use three quick dissolv to compress a scene of a car back away from a build . again , the simpl , mundan explan is that it help the pace . i don't mean to say that his techniqu are not creativ or good-look . but he simpli use the best tool for the job . it shouldn't have surpris me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystic religion , actual turn out to be quit straightforward . the movi follow the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritu and polit leader of tibet . the movi titl is anoth name for the dalai lama which mean " ocean of wisdom . " his stori is told in strict chronolog order and there are onli a few cinemat vision to embellish the liter stori . ( one of which make an interest statement : pay attent to the film open shot and watch where it is repeat . ) we first glimps the dalai lama when he is two year old . his curios and self-assured captur the attent of a monk wander in search of the new lama . a test is arrang to see if this boy realli is the reincarn of the 13 dalai lama who have gone befor . sever item belong to the previous dalai lama are laid befor the boy alongsid some other item . the child is ask if he recogn ani of the item as his own . the boy pick correct , prove that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . scorses and long-tim editor thelma schoonmak were kind enough to allow the possibl that the child was take his cue from the monk . befor select an item , he would look at the monk , perhap for some sort of confirm . sometim he pick right the first time , and sometim he made a second choic . either way , whether through reincarn or quick human percept , the tibetan were assur of choos a boy who could be a wise , percept leader . >from this point on , the boy is rais as the reincarn of the lama spirit and the futur leader of a nation . it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . in the u . s . it might be ground for a call to social servic . but the young lama accept his destini without ani appar emot damag . neither the great power nor the awesom respons keep him from becom a genuin likeabl , well-round person . certain pattern take shape over the year . for exampl , the dalai lama is fascin by technolog . radio , clock , and telescop are some of his favorit toy . when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he make plan to modern isol tibet . he also has a soft spot for creatur who are suffer or in pain , includ herd anim . it near a run gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from be herd to slaughter . but the most omin constant throughout his life is the presenc and threat of tibet gigant neighbor , china . tibet and it leader prove correct in fear china , as , first the propaganda , then the polit pressur , and final the armi , come across their common border . the chines invas is so success that the lama life is in danger if he stay . the movi end when , after much agon , the dalai lama leav tibet for india . the stori doesn't lead up to a cinemat climax as strong as most featur film do . it just doesn't fit that mold . if it were forc into such a shape it would have been a complet differ movi ( perhap more like seven year in tibet , which is good in it own right ) . the pace of kundun is more calm and level than that . the structur of the film is made to fit the charact and event , not vice-versa . perhap becaus the pace is slower , we have more time to notic the beauti art , vestment , and architectur of tibet . a mandala , ( tibetan sand paint ) with beauti , vibrant color is shown throughout the movi . the robe and hat of state are bright red and gold . the brick are a rich reddish brown , not unlik the skin tone of the tibetan . even the touchston pictur logo befor the movi ( which is usual light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . philip glass compos the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choic . for those who don't know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . his build block are lot of small note , tini grain of music , which are first group , then repeat in pattern . these pattern creat interest textur which are themselv part of a larger composit . peopl won't be flock to kundun for it great end , or talk about it outstand plot , but it doe have a lot to offer : an interest lifetim , exot sight , rich cinematographi , and innov music . it give interest insight into tibetan buddhism and take a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . on top of it all is the cinemat masteri of martin scorses , who give the film a strong , beauti , consist look .

" all the world a stage and all the men and women mere player they have their exit and their entranc and one man in his time play mani part " - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 when william shakespear pen this passag , he could not have possibl envis a world in which the domest activit in an abod would be broadcast across the contin , or where women would instal webcam in their apart in order to convert voyeur into cash . this is the world of today , and it is the perfect climat to unveil a prototyp high-concept project like the truman show . truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seem to have the perfect life . he has a pretti , dote wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfort insur sale posit , an immacul suburban home in the idyl island communiti of seahaven , a reliabl childhood buddi marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paw a greet to him everi morn and his hydrophobia , this is paradis . or so it would seem . bizarr , inexplic incid begin to crop up in truman life . a light fixtur unexpect plummet from the sky . a rainstorm which give new mean to the term isol follow him around . a radio broadcast appear to be describ his everi move . for the first time in his life , it is begin to dawn on truman that thing are not what they appear to be . the truman show , direct by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remark well-construct film , pace perfect with everi scene fluid lead into the next . balanc drama with humour , thought with abandon , this is a film which address an intrigu and intric concept with just the right mixtur of sermon and whimsic fanci . in mani way , mr . niccol screenplay mirror the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both film focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppress advers , with pivot , character-defin moment occur at sea . although the film rather convent climax doesn't sustain the inspir dynam achiev in the first two-third , and ultim just fall short on deliv the intend emot punch , there are moment through the truman show which are genuin stir and move as truman attempt to make sens of his unravel world and grasp the implic behind his discoveri of decept . despit the multitud of pertin issu be broach by the film , it remain foremost a finely-craft piec of entertain , constant light and access . the tone achiev is far too sunni for ani sens of fear paranoia to legitim intrud , and as the carefully-stack seahaven hous of card tumbl down , the film eschew ani psycholog ramif for a man discov that the fundament of his entir exist have been fals . the end act of the truman show essenti boil down to a rehash of the reliabl , crowdpleas underdog vs . the system formula . while the film is an impress realis of an inspir concept , some element are lack . the devic of mysteri lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhon ) as a contribut impetus to truman grow awar isn't exact convinc . there not much of a discern spark between either the two charact or the actor themselv , and the scene in which she indign confront the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harri ) with regard to the moral ambigu of his action unnecessarili spell thing out for the audienc , thank avoid elsewher in the film . in fact , although the film smart restrict the number of scene depict the real world outsid truman artifici utopia to a mere hand of select reaction shot from enraptur gazer , it might have perhap been even more indict and damn to immers itself even * more * deepli in the insulatori seahaven world , with the result effect that the repercuss felt as the film final shift outsid the impos bubbl are all the more startl . still , the scath commentari issu by this film is on target , and it insidi obliqu manner of deliveri is far more effect in convey the messag than the more forthright anti-voyeurist tirad such as that of the recent costa gavra film mad citi . i'v alway believ that the versatil ms . linney possess a tremend comic gift -- she has alway seem to have a impish gleam in her eye -- and in the truman show she run rampant with her duplicit charact , mischiev flash a glaze , insan jovial grin as she perkili recit impromptu product placement slogan . cheer go over the top , it hilari to watch her -- who would have ever guess that she'd have the opportun to outshin the reign king of comedi in the laugh depart of a film ? ms . linney is a delight in the film . but it is mr . carrey who rule the show here . he may not have been intuit the most obvious choic to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is serious lack in ani of the frenet comic interlud which typifi his tradit part -- but he bring to the charact tremend energi and emin appeal : it difficult not to root for truman . in a command perform , mr . carrey lend our protagonist an inher sens of decenc and integr which make him a genuin engag presenc , and acquit himself impress in this dramat turn , demonstr admir restraint -- there an earli scene where he down on his knee garden , and given his past track record , one almost instinct anticip mr . carrey to pull one of more infam , and in this case , wholli inappropri sight gag . it almost poetic how this notori look-at-m actor success tone it down to play a charact who constant the centr of attent . in addit to the fine perform by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particular noteworthi for issu his charact a sens of sturdi trustworthi -- the film is immeasur aid by wonder product design by denni gassner in creat truman antisept , white picket-fenc smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz origin score . technic credit are first-rat all around . while the truman show is clear a definit high-concept film , it not exact a dazzl innov one -- obvious predecessor utilis common element abound , rang from 1965 secret agent through to the groundbreak british 1967 tv seri the prison . all the same , this is a visionari , award-calibr film : entertain , provoc , and intellig . the curious ( and possibl disturb ) thing may be that although upon first glanc the plausibl of the film concept seem unfathom outrag , it abund clear that our societi is rapid approach , if not actualis , at least permiss of such a scenario . perhap the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depict of this bizarro state is so convinc that we accept it without question . perhap we recogn a bit of ourselv in this world .

0 while watch loser , it occur to me that ami heckerl true genius as a film-mak is cast . in fast time at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn jeff spicoli ; in look who talk , she turn bruce willi into a wise-crack babi and provid john travolta with is first career reviv ; in clueless , she found a star vehicl for the ador that is ( or was ) alicia silverston . she seem to understand instinct how to find perform the audienc will like in spite of their flaw . unfortun , she may also be start to understand that she understand . give appeal actor an appeal script creat likeabl movi . give appeal actor a script in which their appeal _is_ the movi make for unexpect aw film like loser . natur , heckerl make her protagonist an all-around swell guy . paul tannek ( jason bigg ) is a small-town boy who get a scholarship to nyu , then instant find himself an island of compass and dilig in the cold-heart big citi . paul is the kind of guy who give up his seat on the subway to an elder woman ; his roommat adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guy who blast their music and let their waterb leak all over paul . paul is also the kind of guy who ador girl from afar , in this case the love dora diamond ( mena suvari ) . dora has problem of her own , includ a shortag of fund to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that more than slight one-sid . they'r two conscienti kid who love anim and homeless peopl , so clear they belong togeth , even if paul is a loser . i must confess that , for a while , i was sucker in by heckerl cast . jason bigg is an engag perform whose unconvent look make him even easier to embrac ; suvari is a coquett with an undercurr of intellig . they'r pleasant enough to watch , and heckerl give us plenti of scene establish how nice they are and how nice their respect antagonist aren't . then it gradual becom clear that there virtual noth to loser but scene of that sort . in theori , loser is a romant comedi , but there is scarc a laugh to be found in the entir film ( notabl except : a cameo by a scene-st comic actor as a video store clerk ) . instead of take ani time to make the charact situat funni , heckerl spend 98 minut make her charact situat pathet . she show none of the ear for quirki dialogu that spark clueless , nor ani of that film interest in live plot ( not surpris , sinc clueless plot came via jane austen emma ) . she simpli turn the film into a piti parti . sinc loser is a film compos almost entir of establish charact , you might think that those charact would be interest , or at least slight complic . instead , you have peopl either so perfect or so unredeem that there no reason to watch them . paul isn't just a nice guy , he flawless ; consequ , he a central charact who doe absolut no grow . his roommat aren't just inconsider , they'r activ evil-blackmail professor alcott , drug women with rohypnol and general give human a bad name . and professor alcott isn't just manipul , he turn dora into his hous slave . dora unthink devot to alcott is the onli whiff of basic human frailti to be found in loser , and even that isn't explor in suffici detail . there more ambigu in the 30-second snippet from alan cum broadway perform as the emce in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it one thing to turn support charact into comic exagger ; it anoth to flatten your lead into easili digest mush . and it would help if those comic exagger were somehow . . . i don't know . . . comic . still , i spent much of the film hold out the ridicul hope that heckerl would somehow salvag loser from it tedium and justifi my desir to like paul and dora . that hope dissolv the moment heckerl underscor a sequenc of paul in the throe of unrequit love to simon and garfunkel " scarborough fair/canticl .

" great stuff . the downsid to spend so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausibl . we'r constant expos to william thought , feel , action and desir , but don't actual get the sens of how much anna realli feel for him . there are a coupl of instanc where she declar her obvious interest , but they near come out of nowher due to the fact that we'r not sure what she been think all the time in between . this , combin with the sheer iniqu of screen time between the two , make this hugh grant film hand down . he get the great scene ( look for one in which he has to portray an interview from hors and hound magazin in order to speak with anna ) , the great line , and give an overal wonder perform . julia robert fan will probabl be disappoint by the actress top bill and subsequ lack of involv in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detach perform which is onli worsen by her charact unpredict behavior . anna doesn't get a lot of our compass . this romant comedi lean a littl more toward the comedi than the romanc , much of it suppli by grant himself , but with consider help from the support cast . most notabl is rhys ifan as spike , william eccentr roommat , who is in the film for no other purpos than to make us laugh . hugh bonnevill , emma chamber , jame dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william friend and famili , particular shine in a scene where william bring anna to his sister birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folk react to the presenc of a movi star in their midst . it a scene most of us will probabl think would play out in our own live room were we face with a similar situat . roger michel use of visual doesn't sweep us off our feet , but doe give us more than your typic movi of this type . for exampl , there are a coupl of instanc in this film where larg amount of time pass . wherea some film are content to simpli put in a caption say " eight month later , " michel present us with more interest cue , such as william walk though his neighborhood while the season chang around him . anoth memor shot occur in a park where the camera is lift from ground level to a coupl of hundr feet in the air . we'r general use to scene where our point of view is lift from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keep go up and up until we have a bird eye view of the ground below . music is use rather glare as an enhanc to mani of the film scene , and some of this might have been better tone down , but in other area it work to full effect . it kind of a mix bag , but still fare better than mani of today lightheart movi which are so influenc by the mtv fare that the film becom one long music video . at least this film has some pretti good music that for the most part remain relev and appropri . not hill grant and robert will not go down in histori as one of the all-tim greatest film pair , but the chemistri is decent and the comed aspect of the movi more than make up for it . for a coupl of hour , you should expect to laugh more than cri , and that not so bad , now is it ?
0 what were they think ? nostalgia for the seventi is bad enough , but do we realli need an eighti film ? robbi hart ( adam sandler ) use to want to be a rock and roll star , but in 1985 he sing at wed and have a good time . a romant at heart , he love wed and is just about to get marri to his high-school sweeti . when she leav him wait at the altar , his tune chang to " love stink " . he meet waitress julia ( drew barrymor ) who is engag to a junk-bond salesman and you know that they are go to get togeth . in fact you know everyth that is go to happen dure this movi . sandler is somewhat adequ in his lead man role , but there is no spark . barrymor doesn't seem to be abl to convey anyth other than a pretti face with noth behind it : beauti but no attitud . both charact are just there . bit part by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show . the eighti are shove in our face . refer to delorean , madonna , " dalla " , ivana and donald , burt and loni and " miami vice " get old fast . the filmmak must have realiz that there wasn't much entertain to the stori and thought they could dazzl the audienc with humor period allus . they'r not funni and it doesn't work . with chang on all front acceler more and more , nostalgia appear to have a great appeal , but don't you think we could have more than 14 year befor we yearn for the past . mayb we can look forward to a film next year wax nostalg about el nino .

1 the calendar year has not even reach it midway point , but that hasn't prevent columbia pictur from trot out a lavish period drama more befit of the winter oscar-bait season . bill august high-profil adapt of victor hugo classic les miser deliv everyth one would expect from a classi hollywood epic--handsom product valu , strong perform by a top-notch cast , a liter screenplay--with one critic miss element : emot sweep . for those not familiar with hugo origin novel or the hit stage music it inspir , the hook of les miser essenti boil down to someth like a 19th-centuri french-set version of the fugit . after serv 19 year in a prison work camp for steal a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is parol . immedi upon releas , he steal valuabl silverwar from a kind bishop who take him in for a night ; he is caught by author , onli to be forgiven by the bishop , who let valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow . that he doe , and in do so break his parol , which set the obsess determin inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guard in valjean prison camp , on his trail . themat , howev , les miser is a stori about redempt , which valjean find through his deal with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitut fantin ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitim daughter , cosett . year after break parol , valjean becom mayor of the town of vigau , where he form a warm friendship with fantin after save her from an unjust arrest by javert . valjean promis the grave ill fantin he will rescu the young cosett ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretak , the thenardi , and rais the child as his own . the " father " and " daughter " eventu land in pari , where the teenag cosett ( clair dane ) fall for dash student revolutionari marius ( han matheson ) . the decades-span stori is the stuff that cinemat epic are made of , and the danish august turn in his most accomplish english-languag work , follow the underr 1994 superstar soap the hous of the spirit and last year stylish but high preposter mysteri smilla sens of snow . he and screenwrit rafael yglesia bring the sprawl tale into clear focus and keep the event move at a brisk pace . product design anna asp , costum design gabriella pescucci , and cinematograph jorgen persson give les miser a sumptuous period look whose accomplish is most match by the effort of the cast . neeson is command yet endear vulner ; rush fine modul menac is far more reward than his overr , oscar-win theatric in shine ; and thurman disappear nice into her high unglamor role . the younger member of the cast fare less well . dane is convinc as cosett , but her overdon lip quiver dure her cri scene becom a distract ; and matheson , while compet , is a less interest robert sean leonard . as technic adept and cerebr engag the film is , by the time les miser was over , my emot had onli been superfici involv . while i was touch by valjean relationship with fantin and cosett , i was not move . not even reach the " touch " level is the cosette-marius pair . my onli previous experi with les miser is with the music ( as i am sure mani other is ) , and i was dismay to see eponin , a friend of marius who selfless die in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost complet jettison from this adapt ( the daughter of the thenardi , here she is onli briefli seen as a child ) . her presenc would have ad some much-need conflict and emot heft to the youth romanc , but i suppos august and yglesia felt one tragic heroin ( fantin ) was enough . even so , as 1998 creep into summer blockbust season , les miser is a thought , well-mad , entertain film , one that will sate moviego hungri for a dose of drama befor popcorn no-brain invad the multiplex .
0 okay , okay . mayb i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movi ; i am the same person that like lethal weapon iii , even while admit that it wasn't as good as the other . howew , the latest segal pictur didn't look that bad , and sinc none of my friend would go see a woodi allen movi even if i paid them , i went to see it expect a mild die hard rehash . boy , was i wrong ! in the first half of the movi , we are alreadi assault with segal act , ( he is not simpli wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuit violenc , an incred plot , sexist and even more gratuit nuditi , and bad line that obvious were meant as joke . by the end , it is obvious that hundr of navi men are no match for thirti arm special forc soldier . not onc in the movi did segal appear worri or undecid , which did not do much for increas the unexist suspens . of cours , in movi like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest . in these one we are given a two for one packag in the form of a playboy model ( in the movi ) , which onli function as a suppos comic relief ( by the way of extrem stupid unfunni line ) , and to have water eye and look away everi time someth bad happen in the movi . oh , of cours , she appear nake from the waist up , and , of cours , segal kiss her at the end after no develop of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interest in each other . i have never seen so littl chemistri between two peopl in a movi . often , the villain save the movi ; unfortun , the villain here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunni , unmenac . how mani movi have psycho ex-speci forc bad guy ? too mani . i was abl to predict the action all throughout the movi , includ the moment where the sidekick save the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceed to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero superior are stupid , the scene where the bad guy lose his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . . simpli said , this is movie-mak by the number , bore , and potenti offens in go for the lowest common denomin of the audienc . my recommend : if you go see it , bring a watch . you'll be look at it for most of the movi . my . rent die hard . read a book . stare at the sky . do not wast your time on this worthless piec of celluloid . the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movi out that i would rather have seen ; onc again , drag in by my friend , which by the way , like the movi halfheart . they probabl like wrestl too : - ) .
0 under ani other circumst , i would not be discuss the end of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . howev , in order to fulli explain exact how and whi this movi is so aw , a minut dissect of the end is necessari . even though i will not reveal the detail of the last scene , do proceed at your own risk . the movi open ( quit poor , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crow ( bruce willi , look like he was drag out of his trailer at the wee hour of the morn to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intrud upon by one of malcolm past patient . distraught , the suicid man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donni wahlberg ) shoot malcolm and then turn the gun on himself . cut to the " next fall " , as we find the good doctor quiet observ his latest case , a troubl young man name cole ( haley joel osment , one of the onli child actor in a while i didn't want to bludgeon over the head with a blunt instrument ) . after about 45 minut of seem unrel freak occurr , we learn that cole has " the sixth sens " , the gift of be abl to communic with the dead . and this , as they say , is where the heal begin . the sixth sens and it unexpect popular is found upon a twist end that i knew go into the film ( one of roger ebert colleg was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of " siskel and ebert " ) . although i was at first enrag that an establish film critic could so callous ruin a film for thousand of patron , i soon realiz that this turn of event could in fact have been a bless in disguis ; i'v alway been a sucker for surpris end ( my favorit movi is the usual suspect ) and rare dislik a film that sport one . here , sinc i knew the major plot twist that was come at the film conclus , the possibl of be bamboozl into love a bad movi sole becaus of it end ( someth i'v fallen victim to in the past ) was elimin . and inde , my view of the sixth sens did prove to be quit an enlighten experi . strip of the element of surpris , the film was put to the task of show what it realli had , instead of simpli hide behind a shock conclus . after see it true color , i came to the conclus that the sixth sens is , despit what the mani champion of the movi may say , void of ani real power . it a neat concept , but not one that justifi be made into a feature-length movi . in fact , the sixth sens reli so strong on it final that the rest of the film develop as a sort of prelud to the suppos earth-shatt revel that is yet to come . and when the final moment do come , it a huge letdown ; the end make no sens at all . it stupefi me with the height of it ineptitud and is complet idiot on a fundament and veri rare level . i won't go into ani detail , but suffic to say that , as far as i can tell , it negat to rest of the movi to such an extent that anyon who buy it even for a second must be suffer from a veri acut case of attent deficit disord . now , in all fair , i cannot say for sure that i would have guess the end ( howev stupid it may be ) had it not been reveal to me befor hand . howev , i feel veri confid that i , as well as anyon who had seen a few " twilight zone " episod , would have seen it come a mile away . the fact that movie-go nation wide are surpris by the end still has me stump . iron , to fulli appreci the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attend a littl girl funer ) , the viewer is requir to be awar of a veri rare psycholog disord call munchausen syndrom by proxi . i wouldn't have even known about this mental diseas if i hadn't , by pure dumb luck , caught " datelin nbc " the other week when they did a featur stori on it . despit be bless with some realli amaz cinematographi and a brauva perform from osment ( where was this kid when cast call were go out for the phantom menac ? ) , in the end , the sixth sens is too chalk-ful of contradict and just isn't plausibl enough to warrant even a slight recommend .

1 warren beatti " bulworth " is a caustic polit comedi that doesn't attack ani particular polit group , but rather the ingrain insincer that has infect the american polit system . some might think this film is vulgar , and in mani way it is . howev , as loud and raucous as it is , " bulworth " speak the truth , which is almost alway ugli to hear . beatti , who direct the film and co-wrot the script with jeremi pikser ( " the lemon sister " ) , star as incumb u . s . senat jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician name in cinema histori . bulworth is a democrat , and in beatti view , he is symbol of everyth that has gone wrong with the current democrat parti . onc an ideolog liber ( like beatti still is ) , bulworth has long sinc succumb to the materialist pressur of washington . instead of wage the battl for the impoverish and the downtrodden , which was onc the call card of democrat , bulworth has becom anoth sell-out money hound - if he not accept illeg bribe from the insur lobbi or take campaign contribut from the chines , he make wind-bag speech that start with the amus clintonesq statement , " america is stand on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . . blah , blah , blah . " when the film open , it is a few day befor the 1996 primari elect , and bulworth is sit at his desk weep becaus he realiz how corrupt he has becom . in a fit of desper , he take out a $10 million life insur polici from a dirti insur rep play by paul sorvino ( part of a shadi lobbi deal to kill a threaten bill in committe ) , and then hire a hit man to kill him , although he doesn't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place . know that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleash his own brand of polit rhetor on the world , which is made up of polit incorrect truth about the state of american polit and the societi in general . at a compton church , he tell the group of african-american that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they " put down that malt liquor and chicken wing , and get behind somebodi other than a run back who stab his wife . " later , in a particular hilari sequenc , bulworth mix with the hollywood elit , then insult the qualiti of their movi and inform them that the onli reason he there is becaus " my guy alway put the big jew on my schedul . " all throughout this physic and polit suicid escapad , bulworth chief of staff , denni murphi ( oliv platt ) , follow behind in a state of constant shock and bewilder . platt has some of the movi funniest scene , as he make murphi into a polit savvi but nonetheless clueless assist who is forc to watch his own career teeter at the brink of be flush down the toilet . his constant half-truth-tel and spin-doctor to cover bulworth stamped is equal in it pervers onli by a self-right report ( nora dunn ) who act like murphi refus to explain bulworth action ( someth he realli cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . when bulworth decid he want to live after all , and therefor must constant evad a grim-look assassin to be who trail him at everi turn , he hide out in the ghetto , complet with a stereotyp gangsta wardrob which he wear to one of his televis interview . at this point , beatti abandon much of the polit aspect and dive into a cartoonish explor of the black inner-c experi . bulworth becom friend with a young black woman name nina ( hall berri ) , who he meet at the harlem church ralli . she has a tough-talk brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster name l . d . ( don cheadl of " boogi night " ) , who also becom involv in bulworth campaign . some of the scene in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feel like a lighter version of scene depict in more intens inner-c film like " boyz'n'hood " ( 1991 ) and " menac ii societi " ( 1993 ) . " bulworth " chief liabil is beatti insist on have his charact adopt a clumsi style of rap as his new communic devic . instead of speak at polit ralli , he break into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a remind of whi almost all hip-hop star are black . it hard to tell whether beatti is be humor by be so bad , or whether he actual that incompet . at ani rate , the rap sound more run d . m . c . than snoop doggi dogg , which make the film seem date instead of contemporari . beatti would have been better off simpli adopt some of the inner-c lingo and work that into his speech , instead of tri to sound like l . l . cool j . other than that , " bulworth " hit all it target with wri , hilari accuraci . the film is like a letter bomb to the democrat parti , and even if you don't agre with beatti liber messag about the unrequit duti of the feder govern , it is hard to deni the impact the film has in explor the monetari and moral debaucheri that infest modern polit . unlik " primari color " which open earlier this year , " bulworth " doesn't tri to tip-to around the truli pain issu that hit close to home - instead , it take them dead-on .
0 two parti guy bob their head to haddaway danc hit " what is love ?

" blare on the soundtrack , the brother duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrel ) bob their head , scope out " hotti " at club , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrust . there is one crucial differ , however--thes guy speak . that littl fact has been use as justif for the film exist , that the butabi newfound capac for speech would open up a whole new set of door for the charact . the door open by director john fortenberri and screenwrit steve koren , ferrel , and kattan are new , that for sure , but they all lead to comic dead end . there is no stori per se , onli a loos structur and link seri of subplot . the brother liter run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entranc into the exclus roxburi club . there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicu uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who take an interest in an idea of their . meanwhil , the bros overbear father ( dan hedaya ) want them to stop club . when doug refus and the dimwit steve obey his father , a rift is creat between the two . the narrat messi of _roxbury_ would have been forgiv if all that went on were the slightest bit funni , but virtual none of it is . the assembl press audienc most sat stonili silent throughout the entir film , with the one big except be a big laugh near the end . ala , the joke--a rather lazi takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--wil onli strike a chord with peopl who have seen that film . grant , a lot of peopl _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film best joke is complet depend on one familiar with anoth film say a lot about _roxbury_ lack of inspir . that lack of inspir can be trace back to the insipid charact themselv . like too mani of the skit on the current incarn of _saturday_night_live_ , " the roxburi guy " is a one-jok sketch that never onc suggest that the charact have enough comic life in them to surviv outsid of the sketch context . after watch one of the " roxburi " skit on snl , this is what you come away with from the charact : they bob their head to " what is love ? " , bump unsuspect women , and . . . that all . after watch _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you'll be left with exact the same .

0 the kid in the hall are an acquir tast . it took at least a season of watch their show on hbo befor i becam a believ . mayb after watch a half dozen kid in the hall movi , they would grow into the big screen . my recommend is that , unless you are a big fan of the kid , skip the film . as it is , their first--and most like only--attempt at a full length film lack the qualiti that made their comedi work on tv . a big-budget and glossi product can not make up for a lack of spontan that permeat their tv show . the kid go through the motion , but you get the feel that they arent realli have fun do so . and this make it more difficult for the audienc to enjoy their antic . brain candi is a bunch of skit tie togeth by the stori of a pharmaceut compani that develop a new drug to cure depress . in typic sketch-comedi tradit , each actor play sever role . doctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team creat the drug . then , under pressur from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and presid of roritor pharmaceut , dr . cooper releas the drug into the marketplac . the ensu distribut of the new happi pill throughout the populac drive the rest of the film . at about 90 minut , brain candi still seem long . the best thing about sketch comedy--and the kid are no exception--i the abil to quick deliv the laugh , then go on to anoth quick skit . but with the addit set-up necessari in tell a longer , coher stori , the laugh just dont come fast enough . strang , the show is even more tame than it was when on cabl tv . the movi make sever attempt at risqueness--most by point up the gay of one of scott thompson characters--but they seem almost forc ; as if they have to live up to a pg rate . one of the best bit , though , doe make use of thompson nake buttock ; we see him charg into battle--go to have sex with some guy take a shower . in the classic of this genr , monti python pull off this delic balanc act between plot advanc and punchlin deliveri for most of the holi grail . the kid , unfortun , are not up to the task . there are some amus moment , to be sure , but not enough to make the experi an enjoy one .
1 anastasia contain someth that has been lack from all of the recent disney releas . . . ( especi hercul ) . . . emot . all the wacki charact voic by celebr and fantast anim adventur sequenc aren't go to hold anyon interest unless there is an emot core to hold it all togeth . not sinc disney beauti & the beast has there been such a compel anim film with interest charact and drama that work . the stori of the romanov famili , the ruler of russia , and their downfal begin the film . anastasia , one of the daughter , narrowli escap the mad monk rasputin ( voic by christoph lloyd ) with her grandmoth ( voic by angela landsburi ) . but anastasia get lost , and grow up with no memori of her royal origin . the grandmoth live in pari , hope to someday find her belov anastasia , the onli member of the famili to surviv the russian revolut . a young woman name anya ( voic by meg ryan ) run across dimitri ( john cusack ) and vlad ( kelsey grammar ) , who are tri to put togeth a scheme to creat an anastasia to fool the grandmoth and get the reward money . they pick anya to pose as their princ , and of cours , it is soon reveal that anya is in fact the lost anastasia . dimitri realiz that he can never win her love as he is a common , and meanwhil , rasputin is not dead , and plot his reveng against the last romanov . the plot is actual quit well structur . there are a lot of complex that may have to be explain to the kid later , but it move along fast enough that they'll never have time to be bore . what this realli mean is that the adult won't be bore by it either . there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is veri funni , and their relationship develop quit natur as the film progress . there is , of cours , lot of comedi for the kid , includ rasputin pet bat , bartok ( hank azaria ) , who is easili the funniest thing in the film . howev , the comic scene never distract from the drama , but are work into the plot almost seamless . the anim is gorgeous - the charact seem to come to life through the talent anim . not sinc beauti & the beast have anim charact had so much life to them . even without the voic , they act . the music number in pari is a show-stopp , with some of the background render in an impressionist paint style . as with all recent anim featur , there are song , howev , these song do more than just provid fodder for top-40 singer to get on the radio ( although there are three of them dure the end credit ) . the song are all veri catchi , and advanc the plot , instead of just be showpiec ( except for the pari number , but that so much fun , it okay . . . ) . i can't reccomend anastasia high enough . it a wonder film that rank right up there with other anim classic . kid and adult alik will enjoy it , and it also nice to have a qualiti anim featur film from anoth studio besid disney .
0 ah , and 1999 was go along so well , too . " she all that " has the dubious distinct of be the worst movi i'v seen so far this year . and quit frank , i doubt i'll see anyth equal bad . ( at least , i * hope * i don't see anyth equal bad ) . " she all that " tell the stori of the most popular guy in school ( play by freddi prinz jr . ) who accept a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school ( rachel leigh cook ) into the most popular . that , right there , is problem #1 . how mani time have we seen this storylin ? as cook comment near the end of the film , " it kind of like " pretti woman " , except without the prostitut " . of cours , had the filmmak attempt to tri someth new with this materi , the well-worn storylin would have been a devic to propel the movi forward . as it is , though , " she all that " reli * complet * on the lame and overus formula to push it ahead . there not one origin or interest charact in the film , either , and if that wasn't bad enough , there not one good perform featur . the star of the movi , rachel leigh cook , is simpli horribl . i usual don't like to get so person , but in this case , i think it need to be said . cook wear the same express throughout the flick and look to be have as miser a time as i was . i was never convinc that she was a " nerd " , and her transform was unconvinc and unnecessari . the movi seem to be say it better to be popular than to be who you are . as for freddi prinz jr . , an actor i ordinarili enjoy , he too is quit bad here . he coast through the film on so-cal charm , and never establish a real charact . kieren culkin is here , too , as the brother of cook . and for some indiscern reason , he got hear aid . no explan is given and they'r never brought up . were we suppos to feel * sorri * for him just becaus he wore hear aid ? i don't think so . that singl element of the film was one of the most offens thing i'v seen in a movi in a long time . " she all that " suck . that what it boil down to . it not entertain , and it not even a good time passer . the hour and a half run time goe by slower than a 5 minut hair-remov system informerci . and what wors , it send out a bad messag to teen . it appear to be tell them , " hey , it doesn't matter if you'r happi the way you are . that unimport . if you want to * truli * be happi , dress in the latest fashion and act like a bubble-head moron . " ugh .
1 it terribl unfortun that " stir of echo , " taut written and direct by david koepp ( who made one of 1996 unsung treasur , " the trigger effect " ) , should be releas littl more than a month after " the sixth sens , " which is still go strong at the box offic . these two film are undoubt go to be compar ( judg from practic all of my fellow audienc member last night ) , and although they have eerili similar storylin , " stir of echo " is more of a straightforward psycholog horror film , while " the sixth sens " is closer to a psycholog drama . addit , while " the sixth sens " had a shocker of an end that undoubt has been one of the major factor in it recent repeat busi , " stir of echo " is more convent and predict in it final twist . and where " the sixth sens " was disturb , " stir of echo " is just plain scari . i have a feel most viewer are go to come away unimpress becaus of the unavoid similar , and will foolish forget to judg this film on it own respect merit . adapt from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forti year ago , " stir of echo " open with a cute six-year-old boy name jake ( zachari david cope ) who is take a bath . he is speak direct at the screen , but we immedi have a feel someon els is there . final , he ask , " doe it hurt to be dead ? " appar jake see the ghost of dead peopl , but unlik " the sixth sens , " this young child isn't the focus of the pictur . instead , tom witzi ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . jake is his son , and maggi ( kathryn erb ) , whom has just discov she is six week pregnant , is his hard-work wife . one night while at a parti with their closest friend , tom convinc maggi new-ag sister , lisa ( illena dougla ) , to tri and hypnot him . it unexpect work , and befor long , tom is see thing he wouldn't normal see , includ a deceas teenag girl ( jenni morrison ) in his hous who happen to have been miss for the last six month . seek help from lisa , she tell him that , while he was under hypnosi , she told him that after he awok , his mind will remain clear and free , like an open door . she didn't expect it to work , but it did , and the onli way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he see . " stir of echo " isn't a perfect film by ani stretch of the imagin , but in the thick , atmospher mood it conjur up , it is a terrif eeri domest horror-drama , and is not onli effect on a technic level , but is impress in it portray of a struggl working-class famili . kevin bacon and , especi , kathryn erb ( 1997 " dream with the fish " ) , are top-notch and exceed believ as a love marri coupl who nonetheless have their fair share of problem . after tom is hypnot and start see ghast vision , he is complet taken over by his desir to solv this mysteri of the disappear girl whom he has seen lurk in his hous , and instead of maggi not be understand , she instead believ what tom say , and asid from be a littl worri by what he is go through , doe not tri to stop his pursuit . bacon and erb are not tradit hollywood star like tom cruis and julia robert , and therefor , are easier to relat to and alway plausibl as a struggl coupl who have to work overtim at their job just to make end meet . in a masterfully-don , entranc sequenc , tom is hypnot by lisa , but instead of watch him , we instead see what he see , start from his view as he close his eye into dark . lisa tell him to visual be in an empti movi theater , and so , we , as audienc member , are watch a movi screen from insid a theater , which is also show a movi screen in a theater . tell him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzi word in black letter pop up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is " sleep . " never befor have i seen a hypnot scene as mesmer and brilliantly-constru as this one . truth , this set-piec , and anoth in which tom wake up from a nightmarish dream onli to quick discov he is reliv what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admiss alon , just to see them on the big screen . have load of fun with her small role as maggi sister , lisa , illeana dougla ( 1995 " to die for , " her last great charact ) is a delight , but rare use to her full advantag in featur film . funni and enjoy offbeat , dougla get to utter the best line in the film : while talk to maggi about tom vision of the girl , she remark , " i wouldn't be worri about him see anoth girl , although the fact that she dead give one paus . " also of note are jenni morrison ( 1994 " intersect " ) , who is truli poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what realli happen to her miss charact , and liza weil , remark in 1998 " whatev , " as morrison griev teenag sister , debbi . if the resolut of " stir of echo " doe not live up to it obvious fright full potenti ( and it doesn't ) , what come befor is both involv and appropri gritti . the music score , by jame newton howard , and unsettl use of whisper and ghost sound effect , success compliment and foreshadow the off-kilt frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp prove onc again that he is a director with a knack for creat almost unbear tens situat that revolv around realistically-written charact . " stir of echo " isn't as good as " the sixth sens , " but whi should it need to be ? both film are fulli capabl of stand on their own two feet , and " stir of echo " realli is a spinetingl good horror film .

1 the relax dude ride a roller coaster the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the most surreal situat are ordinari everyday life as view by an outsid . when those observ are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becom bizarr . when the life is that of jeff " the dude " leboswki , the bizarr fall over the edg into the world of " what'sgoingonaroundher " . the marvel sound of " the stranger " ( sam elliot ) 's voice-ov introduc the film . at least it doe until he forget what he was go to say and give up . the dude ( jeff bridg ) is describ as the " laziest man in los angel , possibl the world " , although he not so much sloth as he is relax . spend the last 30 year with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he have a good time . when ask what he doe for fun , he respond " bowl , drive around and the occasion acid flashback " . lebowski passion is bowl . when he not roll the ball down an alley toward a strike , thing just happen to him . arriv home one night , he beaten by thug attempt to collect money that his wife owe them . even wors , they urin on his rug . the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife . his assail realiz that their target is a differ lebowski when they glanc around at his apart . the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionair and his dude live in two-room squalor . the next day , our ragtag hero visit his namesak mansion attempt compens for his soak rug . the carpet is import to him becaus it pull the room togeth : not surpris sinc it virtual the onli object there . when he deni ani money , he pick up a replac rug off the floor . on his way out , he run into lebowski trophi babe wife bunni ( tara reid ) who offer to perform a sexual act that , accord to rumor , is one of bill clinton favorit for a thousand buck . the penniless dude wisecrack that he head for the cash machin . later he get an unexpect phone call enlist his aid in be the bag man to deliv a ransom to bunni kidnapp . this begin the trademark coen brother crimes-gone-wrong sequenc . the kidnapp are imposs inept . the dude and his croni are even wors . everi plan goe awri . you can almost see lebowski brain churn in slow motion as he tri to figur out the clue . that the stori , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter . there could be almost ani plot and the film would be just as entertain . the narrat onli exist so we can watch the offbeat charact and the quirki predica they fall into . the dude bowl buddi walter ( john goodman ) and donni ( steve buscemi ) look like peopl you'd see on the street but , like everyth els in this film , they'r not quit what they seem . walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixti . everyth that happen remind him of a situat in the nam . when a fellow bowler cross the foul line but won't admit it , walter pull a gun on him until he mark a zero on the score sheet . donni get precious few word in between walter scream and the dude rambl . when he doe , walter shout him down with horrend albeit seem unintent bowl pun . donni is " out of his leagu " and doesn't " have a frame of refer " . the film is pepper with peopl for whom the term " charact " would be an understat . the big lebowski daughter maud , an avant-gard " vagin " artist , paint while swing nake in a leather apparatus like an s&m mari martin . the kidnapp are german techno nihilist biker . bunni lebowski is a high school cheerlead turn porno star . most impress is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispan bowler . as the flamenco music swell , we see him put on his lavend hose . the camera pan up to an all-purpl skin-tight bowl outfit with " jesus " ( pronounc with a " j " , not an " h " ) embroid on the pocket . he address the lane with intens serious and one paint fingernail . his tongu slowli snake out and love lick the glow bowl ball . bridg work the dude as if he had been live him for decad and mayb he has . i can't think of anyon els who could have done a better job . buscemi has a limit role , but he play it perfect . the more that i see john goodman the more convinc i am that he one of the treasur of our time . it odd to think that most of the world know him onli as roseann barr televis husband . more like the coen " rais arizona " than their hit " fargo " , " the big lebowski " demand an open mind and even more open eye . a mark of the coen brother is that even with all wonder dream sequenc and the broad slapstick physic comedi on the screen , much of the humor is subtl and easi to miss . there so much go on that frequent it disappear befor you can see it . walk out of the theater , i felt that the film had someth import to say . on further examin , i wasn't sure exact what it was . " if you meet jesus at the bowl alley , it not go to be what you expect " ? " when the go get weird , the weird go bowl " ? mayb there no real messag . perhap it just a roller coaster ride through a hilari world . mayb that enough .

1 albert brook save the day , just in the nick of time . with a veri poor summer for movi , brook is just what audienc were look for to cheer them up , and doe so in a posit way . while this may not be his finest work , " the muse " still shake up some delight humor . in albert brook latest comedi , he tell a stori of a troubl screenwrit ( brook ) who lose his edg , as his busi partner say . in desper , he goe to see his friend jack ( jeff bridg ) , who has been a veri success screenwrit in the past . he ask jack for some help , and reciev word of a real life muse , that has help him and mani other director throughout their career . so brook seek the muse name sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is sucker into buy her expens , food etc . as a sort of payment . the real punch line howev , doesn't come until the end . it realli make you wonder , how screenwrit realli get their idea , could it simpli be from a friend or a bum in the street ? the idea itself is provok and brook doe it in a hilari manner . speak of brook , he was absolut hyster as a screenwrit . everi time he grace the screen , i can't help but start laugh . albert has a veri uniqu sens of humor that make him a veri likeabl charact . the real problem with the film lie with sharon stone . she wasn't likeabl at all . brook had the right idea with her occup , but she never pull through . in a way , she drain energi from the onc funni atmospher and left it bleak . luckili brook could clean up the mess , and cover for stone mishap . it was a shame that the film went slight downhil after her appear , becaus " the muse " had the potenti to a be a veri authent comedi . on a brighter note , andi macdowel was also charm as brook wife . she is alway a nice addit as a support actress , becaus she has that charisma that seem to complet the atmospher to ani film she in . the funniest moment in " the muse " in my opinion were the cameo by jame cameron and martin scorses . i mean imagin , brook see these big name director in his back yard seek sharon stone for advic , like it was someth out of the ordinari . it was just plain hilari . it just add to the satir joke , of how director get idea . brilliant move by brook . as i mention befor , the film is a satir much like it proceed bowfing , which came out a few week befor . unlik bowfing , this is not a mean spirit film that desper for joke , it rather a witti and humor look at hollywood . " bowfing " had it moment , but had quit a few problem that were never work out , but " the muse " still manag to keep the laugh despit a bit of a detour . by the end of the film , you'r glad to see a good hearti comedi come out of it . for onc i'm not fulli disappoint , becaus the film didn't slow down , it kept move , even with some flaw . thumb up to brook for his brave effort . i think he'll still manag to keep his edg around well into the futur .
0 this movi stink ! although it is profession craft and there are some decent perform , the plot is so bad it drag the film into the abyss . i knew i was in for troubl when , dure the open establish shot , we see a detail close-up of warrant offic paul brenner ( john travolta ) militari identif card and it is the wrong color . this might seem like a minor detail , but anyon who has spent anytim with the militari know that activ duti identif card are green and depend card are yellow . and what about the senior militari offic whose uniform shirt is so wrinkl he look like he is a recruit on his first day of train . or what about when brenner tell a suspect that , becaus he is in the militari , he doesn't have the right not to answer his question even though these right were central to militari law well befor the miranda decis . how hard is it to get someon familiar with the militari to check these fact ? now detail like this could be overlook if the under stori held up , but this stori is so full of hole it is pain to sit through . for exampl , at the begin of the film , paul brenner , an undercov armi investig , get into a gun and knife battl at his off-post houseboat and winds-up kill an arm dealer he had been investig . the local polic investig the death are open hostil to the militari and they discov that brenner has been lie to them about the kill . but instead of arrest him , or at least take him into custodi for further question , they releas him . duh ! ultim , brenner get assign to investig the murder and possibl rape of the command general daughter , a young captain also assign to the post . when brenner find graphic sex tape featur the general daughter , doe he use them to generat a suspect list and begin grill suspect . no , his instinct is to suppress them becaus they might be potenti embarrass . eventu , brenner discov that this murder is relat to a violent gang rape at west point eight year earlier . i won't even go into the total unbeliev rational for the armi suppress of this horrend crime . i will just mention one final flaw . brenner is investig a crime that occur in georgia . the rape occur in west point , which is in new york . he is under a veri tight ( and total implaus ) 36-hour deadlin to solv this case . he need to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point . doe he phone the doctor ? no , he travel ( via some unexplain veri fast transport ) to new york to question the psychiatrist in person , and then he return to georgia ( again by the miracl transport ) , without onc worri about the impact ani of this will have on his deadlin . you have been warn , stay away from this one .

" how can a movi have guest star ? " you may ask . well , blade squad is not realli a movi so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possibl tv seri packag as a movi . blade squad is dumb . blade squad is loud . blade squad is obnoxi . blade squad will probabl be a rate hit and spawn a long-liv tv seri . whi not ? after all , televis has given it audienc crimefight with talk car ( " knight rider " ) , fast helicopt ( " airwolf " ) , and super fast motorcycl ( " street hawk " ) , and viewer have eaten it up in the past . so , whi not crimefight with jet-pow roller blade ? to be honest , as a made-for-tv present , blade squad is at least watchabl . the film has a relat larg cast of charact , a surpris intellig albeit predict script , and enough action sequenc to keep one half-interest . i'd imagin adolesc male , probabl the target audienc of this turkey , would get a kick out of it . i tri to keep that in mind when i watch blade squad . i can rememb like " airwolf " and " street hawk " when i was 10 or 11 . and , although this isn't say much , blade squad is leap and bound better than the last fox network movi i had the displeasur of wast time on : the insipid aw generat x ( a huge disappoint consid the comic book terrif two-year begin ) . but , i digress . despit it limit appeal , blade squad has a lot of kink to work out if the movi is to becom a tv seri . one , it suffer from mtv syndrom : a lot of quick shot and weird angl continu jar the viewer sens while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blare incess in the background . oh yeah , dylan " knockin on heaven door " and bowi " i'm afraid of american " are use here , in rather poor tast . two , blade squad need a new crew for the sound . the substandard sound edit irrit me to no end . charact dialogu , at time , sound choppi and unintellig . dure one import scene , a song play loud in the background . when a charact spoke , the song volum drop but did not disappear . as soon as that charact finish speak , the song volum immedi return to it origin level until the next charact spoke . this sound trivial , i'm sure , but it distract me immens . final , this is commerci televis . foul languag is not allow , typic , on commerci televis . thus , don't use foul languag in a made-for-tv product becaus that foul languag has to be censor in some manner . in an earli scene of the film , for exampl , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confront in the street . when the good guy spout out a bad word , a driver conveni honk his car horn off-screen to muffl the word out . in a " seinfeld " episod , this techniqu prove funni ; here , it seem goofi and cut the dramat tension consider . perhap futur writer , if a show is spun out of the movi , could take a cue from marvel comic 2099 seri of comic . make up a bunch of new bad word for the futur . this way , you don't need a bunch of honk horn or other silli devic to cover up foul languag . compar to the usual crap broadcast tv network have to offer in term of movi , blade squad is a suitabl exercis in camp . when compar to , say , a movi studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which share it initi : bs .

1 " i know what you did last summer , " the first high-profil slasher thriller to be releas after 1996 " scream , " and written by the same screenwrit , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effect horror film that becam 1997 biggest hit of the fall season . while " scream " was a more know film about the genr , " i know what you did last summer " is more reminisc of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intellig than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilti pleasur as all nine of the " friday the 13th " film ( well , okay , " jason goe to hell " was pure hell to sit through ) . the film start off with four talent , aspir teenag friend who have just graduat from high school in their small boat town of southport , n . c . it is the 4th of juli , and they will soon be head their separ way . kind-heart juli ( jennif love hewitt ) , and outsid ray ( freddi prinz jr . ) will be head off to colleg , while helen ( sarah michell gellar ) , who has just been honor croaker queen in the town , and her ignor jock boyfriend , barri ( ryan phillipp ) , are go to new york to becom an actress and footbal player . when the four of them travel to a nearbi mountain-sid beach for the even , they are dismay after hit a man in the road on their way home . distraught and confus , they decid they can't go to the polic becaus they will be charg with manslaught , so they devis a plan to throw the appar dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hope no one will find him . juli is apprehens about it , but is forc into it by barri . switch to exact a year later , juli , still unabl to come to term with what she did , reluct return home from colleg to find that all three of her old friend are still in the town becaus their career plan did not work out . almost immedi , juli reciev an omin letter that simpli read , " i know what you did last summer , " and that is the start of their problem as they find themselv be terror by a mysteri figur dress in fisherman gear and yield a giant hook . " i know what you did last summer , " is a success horror film for a number of reason . the cinematographi by deni crossan could veri well be describ as hitchcockian , as it put shadow , fog , steam , and other clever devic to add atmospher to the proceed . the charact , particular juli and helen , are realist written , and the film amaz deal with their broken relationship in a few scene , which is larg uncharacterist in film of this sort . and last , the film creat a few dazzl and scari set-piec that are some of the most memor i'v seen in a horror movi , particular the suspens , superbl shot sequenc involv helen at her famili store with the killer insid with her . perhap the best charact is that of missi egan ( ann hech ) , a lone backwood woman whose brother was the one juli think they hit . hech perform is a standout , as she is abl to creat a full charact in onli about ten minut of screen time . " i know what you did last summer , " could have been a great horror movi if not for a few problem . prinz jr . give a perform to be desir here , and much of his dialogu sound wooden come out of his mouth . also , the climax of the film almost complet lose it frighten grip after it unveil the mysteri killer , who is a decid bad actor and should not have been given ani line . luckili , the penultim scene save the disappoint final , which includ an expert craft " jump-in-your-seat " scare . in the main role , hewitt and gellar are high talent , and hewitt , especi , is one of the best screamer i'v ever heard . she honest could give jami lee curti a littl competit for the best " scream queen . " and gellar is touch as a young woman who , in the cours of one year , find her dream of be an actress ultim shatter . although not up to the level of either " scream " movi , or the more recent , " urban legend , " " i know what you did last summer " is a respect , smartly-script slasher film that firm prove good horror movi were onc again be made .
0 m : i-2 , the sequel to mission imposs , is a jame bond wannab film , but it fail to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertain valu . it tri to be a spy/rom movi , but without ani suspens the film just look like it an extend commerci for dude who think they look cool in throwaway sunglass . it is a film that prefer techi gadget to anyth human . the coolest thing about this movi , was all the hole it had in it stori and the most trite thing about the movi , was the usag of dove throughout as peac symbol . the film play as if it was a wet fantasi dream about techi violenc . except for the choreograph action sequenc , the film was dull for three-quart of it time , fill with too mani dead spot in it stori to garner concern about it wooden charact or the superfici romanc that develop . as for the action scene , they might look good to those who are convert to violenc in their film , but their advertis for sadist respons , is noth short of mindless cartoon violenc , which make it veri difficult to sit back and applaud without feel put off by the gratuit cruelti seen . m : i-2 open and close with fast-pac action scene , but it is hard to get past the middl part which just drag on in banal dialogu . the film look as if it had been invad by a comput virus , at that point . the onli thing that kept me awak , was the horribl music compos by han zimmer that becam veri loud at ani of the film suppos moment action scene and seem to make an uninterest scene even more notic in the wrong way . it a mega-buck film adapt from a popular high-tech gadgetri tv seri . but it artist success is an imposs task to accomplish becaus it hire the wrong director and actor to star in it , and it fail to produc a stori that had ani substanc . john woo ( " broken arrow " / " face/off " ) is good at do car chase , choreograph fight with midair flip and kung-fu kick , slo-mo shot of two gun blaze , and of fire explos , but he just can't seem to handl dialogu and suspens . the star of the film and co-produc , tom cruis , and his romant interest , thandi newton , are miscast . cruis is no jame bond and look more like a yuppi than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocu smile , as he tri to carri off this macho role , while thandi is not an action-film girl , and seem like a fish- out-of-wat in this one . their romanc didn't work , not onli was it tepid and not sexi , but it wasn't convinc . the film open with dizzi speed , perhap with the hope that a befuddl audienc is it best bet for success . we will be in three differ locat instantan : sydney , the american southwest , and sevill . first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffl russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mention that he creat a dead killer virus call chimera and an antidot for it . he also mention that everi hero need a worthi villain . which explain the film mythic theme . . . as we enter the world of comic book myth on good and evil . the one who play the villain , dougray scott , doe so in a one-dimension gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsens . soon the diabol scientist is on a plane talk to someon he trust call dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorist who set it on automat pilot and crash it into the rocki mountain . befor they crash the plane and parachut out of it , the one who was pose as dimitri , turn out to be sean ambros ( scott ) , a rogu member of the imf , which is a cia-lik clone . he steal the packag with the antidot , peel off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the stori , ethan hunt ( cruis ) , who had pose as dimitri to the scientist befor and had therebi gain his trust . sean and his group of terrorist carri out this attack becaus they plan a virus plagu on the world and then to sell the victim the antidot at mark up price . we alreadi saw the gimmick of peel mask use in face/off and in the origin mission imposs , which as convolut a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . woo has run this peel mask routin into the ground , as it is use so often in this film by both side , so much so , that it blur ani ethic charact differ between good guy or villain . it make it seem as if anyon could be anoth charact , which distort the realiti of the film and make it imposs for the film to make much sens . next we are in a mountain rang in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacat , hang by his fingertip while climb and look cool , when a helicopt with his boss anthoni hopkin aboard , deliv via a rocket launcher , a pair of talk sunglass . hunt learn his next mission is to retriev the chimera packag and he is allow to pick two regular imf agent to help , billi baird ( john polson ) and luther stickel ( ving rhame ) , with luther run a high-gadget comput , but he also must get a jewel thief name nyah hall ( thandi ) to join his team . he is told , as an incent to recruit her , all her crimin charg will be drop . hopkin then sign off with the tag line : this messag will self-destruct in five second . actual , with the departur of hopkin , it was this dispos film that actual self-destruct at this point . in sevill , hunt recruit nyah into the team in the middl of a jewel heist and a subsequ car chase , where he

1 usual when one is debat who the modern queen of the romant comedi is they will bring up name like julia robert or sandra bullock . other will mention meg ryan . but for me , it not even close . janean garofalo is not onli the queen of the romant comedi , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now . and it a good thing she star in the matchmak , becaus without her presenc the movi would be bland , unfunni , and dull . garofalo star as marci tizard , a top aid to boston senat john mcglori , who is suffer in the poll . in an attempt to captur the irish vote , he send marci on a mission to a small irish town call ballinagra in search of other mcglori that never move to america . unfortun for marci , her visit coincid with the town annual matchmak festiv . thing get off to a rocki start for marci though . she has no hotel reserv ( for no ration reason ) and the tini confin room ( tire old clich ) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub . his name is sean , and marci find him repugn at first , so you can obvious tell where this is head . the movi run into a few roadblock . for instanc , the stori is veri thin . none of the charact ( except the old local matchmak ) are near as interest as garofalo . some of the charact , like the polit aid play by deni leari , have wander in from a complet differ movi . i think the director realiz this and decid to throw in numer shot of the beauti irish sceneri , and sever close-up of garofalo win smile . the strang thing is that it work . garofalo charm and the irish sceneri could carri the thinnest of stori , and it carri this one .

0 " return to horror high , " want to be a coupl differ type of movi at onc . the film tell the stori of a low-budget horror movi be film at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murder took place five year befor . but what the cast and crew don't know is that a real killer , mayb the same one that was never apprehend , is go into action again . on one level , " return to horror high " is a slasher movi , and it is at this level that it work the best on . watch the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn't help but take notic that the killer costum was almost identit to that of the ghostfac in , " scream , " and " scream 2 . " on anoth level , the film want to be a slapstick comedi , and there are mani hint of this throughout . unfortun , most of these joke fall flat . and the last thing the film want to be is a " behind-the-scen " look at an exploit film be made . the onli problem is that , while much of it is suppos to be from the movi itself be made , no camera are shown film it , thus make it far more confus than it had to be . and to top it all off , the " twist " end make veri littl to no sens whatsoev , and so we are basic left with feel as if we wast our time . there are stori develop that are beyond ludicr , and plot hole you could drive a winnebago through . if you see the film , or have seen it , you'll know what i mean . the premis of " return to horror high , " is admit pretti crafti , and i like the atmospher of the school , which is where the whole thing take place . but director froehlich , judg from this movi , is an incompet director , except for be abl to film the seldom suspen scene . well , come to think of it , there is onli one scene that is actual scari , and it has to do with two actor be lock in a room as the killer tri to break in . but other than that two-minut distract , " return to horror high , " is certain no great shake . note : look for georg clooney in a support role as one of the actor on the film . and strang enough , he is the first charact to get the ax . . . liter .

1 bill condon " god and monster " is a fascin look into the last day in the life of gay director jame whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classic " frankenstein " and " bride of frankenstein . " sinc i was unfamiliar of whale prior to view the film , there is no way to know how accur the film is , but i suspect that much of it onli came from whale inner fantasi and hallucin . whale , who fought in wwi and then went on to becom known for his work on horror pictur , decid fifteen year befor his death at age 67 to quit filmmak onc a homosexu scandal broke out involv him . as the film tell it , dure the end of his life , whale , at his larg home in l . a . , becam infatu with the tall , handsom , and much younger man , clayton boon ( brendan fraser ) , who was work as the garden at his home . jame whale , we learn quick was , what mani peopl refer to him as in the film , " a dirti old man . " in one of the open scene , a young film enthusiast visit whale home to interview him and whale agre , on one condit : for everi question he answer , the young man must take off an articl of cloth . becaus of this episod , we know exact what it is whale want when he ask clayton to pose for him for a paint , later make the excus that his bright , white shirt is disract onli so he will take it off . clayon agre , and doesn't realli think much of this , much to the warn of his friend , becom more and more intrigu in the stori whale tell him about his past . certain , the relationship between whale and boon is head for a downfal , sinc whale start to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boon is not gay , and whale himself realiz he is near the conclus to his life , as he begin to seldom suffer mild stroke and moment of true catharsi . " god and monster " is an intim and seem respect portrait of a director who was forc to becom somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual prefer , and never got the recognit he would have like , sinc he long to be refer to as a " motion pictur director , " rather than a " horror director . " and in one heartbreak scene , he attend a parti with boon be his guest , held by director georg cuckor , and find that mani of the other attende do not recogn him anymor . it is evid that whale first love in his life was make movi , and when his career ultim fell apart , so did his passion in life . as play brilliant by ian mckellen , jame whale come off as a sad , but dignifi man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from other , just as long as he knew he was be true to himself . he never hid the fact that he was gay , howev , even if it meant threaten his filmmak profess , and it was this unblink honesti that made him a great person . through the complic relationship that develop between whale and boon , boon , of cours , onli thing of whale as a possibl friend or someon he can talk to , while it mean so much more to whale , who see boon as sort of his salvat in life . although boon is onli in a dead-end job as a garden of peopl home , whale view him as the ideal man , not onli one that is good-look , even though it is this attract that first begin his feel , but one that will actual listen to him . sinc whale live with onli his loyal , but disapprov maid ( touch portray by lynn redgrav ) , it is boon that whale can talk to in his ultim reclus from the world , and the onli reason whale final decid to attend the gather of georg cuckor . although an extrem fine and matur pictur , a few small element hold the film back from ultim great . it is appreci that the film doe not pull for ani obvious or over dramat stori develop , but it is a littl thin , and the structur of the " on-again-off-again " friendship at the film center is fair predict . we know earli on where these two charact are head , and we can guess that there will be a final confront between the two as the tension slowli build . in lesser hand , this set-up might have felt too calcul , but it is not in the surpris deft treatment and write that help the film to be much more than this . also , a subplot is briefli brought up between clayton and a waitress work at a bar ( effect play by lolita davidovich ) , but abrupt drop and never brought up again . if the film was not go to follow up on this side stori , then it , perhap , should have been taken out altogeth . " god and monster " is a heartfelt and intellig motion pictur , impress direct by bill condon , who , i sens , relat to or fulli understand the mean behind the curious relationship between whale and boon . the film also play as a tribut to a fine man who met an untim end . walk away from " god and monster , " it was ian mckellen marvel and astound perform that left the most impress on me , and i doubt there could have been anyon who could have step into the role more fulli and believ . it is a sad testament when a person true talent and love is unfair taken away from them , base on the scrutin and judgement of their person life , which , iron enough , is no one els busi in the first place .
0 i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movi can be consid an exploit flick . take the profession , for exampl . it boast extrem glossi cinematographi , a coupl of recogniz name actor , and a coupl of fair impress explos . it also basic about violenc and cheap titil , and featur a central relationship between a middle-ag man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decid ambigu sexual dimens . the profession is all over the map , and it pretens of be about anyth more than it most unpleas element simpli make it all the more unpleas . the profession of the titl is a new york hit man name leon ( jean reno ) , brutal effici but also veri isol . one day he is forc to let someon into his life when a girl from his apart build knock on his door . her name is matilda ( natali portman ) , and the rest of her famili has just been kill by crook and veri wire d . e . a . agent norman stansfield ( gari oldman ) after matilda father tri to rip him off . leon reluct take matilda in , then begin to teach her his profess when she say that she want to aveng the murder of her young brother . the two becom closer , which make them all the more vulner when stansfield learn that they know too much , and set out to elimin them both . writer/director luc besson has gone this rout befor with his popular french import la femm nikita , a slick potboil about a femal assassin . there is no question that besson can make a great * look * film ; with the assist of cinematograph thierri arbogast , he has creat a film chock full of moodi close-up and evoc light . but beneath the shini wrapper , there isn't near as much go on as besson would like us to believ . the relationship between leon and matilda never click becaus neither one is given a charact to develop . leon is most a collect of quirki trait , all intend to show us that for a hire killer , he realli not so bad a guy : he drink lot of milk , take meticul care of a pot plant , and enjoy gene kelli movi . jean reno succeed at give leon a haunt and desper qualiti , but he never make an emot connect to matilda . natali portman is all wrong for a part that call for a much grittier qualiti , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . besson would have been better serv spend more time tri to bring his charact to life , and less on feebl attempt at humor which are often embarrass . a silli game between leon and matilda involv celebr imperson is complet out of place , as is a scene where matilda shock a hotel manag by announc that leon is her lover ; charact is thorough sacrif for a cheap gag . gari oldman entir part is someth of a cheap gag , wild-ey and way over the top , but at least he is interest to watch . there isn't a real person to be found anywher in the profession , which isn't alway a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is tri to pass itself off as someth more . a more disconcert problem with the profession is that it play around with the sexual of a twelve-year-old in a realli distast way . there were onli two real choic for deal with that compon of leon and matilda relationship : confront it head on , or ignor it entir . but besson flirt and teas the audienc with the idea that he go to show them a forbidden love stori , while choos simpli to focus his camera on portman rear end and dress her in skimpi cloth . this is to say noth of the question decis to make it look like qualiti patern time when leon is teach a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spill aplenti . a great deal of the time , the profession is just plain sleazi , and all the soft filter in the world can't disguis that fact .

1 in mani way , " twotg " doe for tough-guy movi what la confidenti did for polic stori . there savvi in it write and a matur patienc in allow the materi to unfold . but , i suppos , we wouldn't expect less from christoph mcquarri , who was respons for give us " the usual suspect " . his write talent are still in tact as he bring to us a bloodi yet intellectu tale of two unabash but dimwit thug and a plan gone awri . the two goon are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillip and benicio del toro ) . these two men show the harden wear of those who have alway had it tough . their troubl youth have forg two nihilist soul who use their amaz gunplay skill to surviv . given the choic of minimum wage or petti crime , they'll alway choos the latter . yet , they are incred foolish planner . actual , these two never realli have a plan . they just improvis along the way , hope that their bravado and arsenal of gun will take care of anyth that they might have overlook . their next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald burger , is to kidnap some surrog mother name robin ( juliett lewi ) that was hire by some well-to-do famili . if all goe well , they'll receiv a nice bit of ransom money and life goe on . what parker and longbaugh do not realiz is that robin is carri a babi for the chidduck famili , whose patriarch is a fear crime boss . moreov , two bodyguard ( nicki katt and tay digg ) constant escort her . these two protector find an eeri sens of pleasur when be confront and test in life and death situat . they would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equal high . but it seem that the testosteron level of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusu but fun-to-watch tactic to pull off the kidnap and to outrun the pursuer in a sort of slow-mot car chase down a seri of alleyway . the next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situat . dure this time , addit plot line come into play and more and more detail are reveal . becaus the chidduck can not go to the polic and becaus of the special circumst involv the kidnap , we are introduc to more charact that will help to influenc the outcom . we discov that not everyon in the chidduck camp is loyal to the caus . as a result , there are undercurr of a conspiraci , and element of betray and subterfug . the sepia-ton atmospher is made all the more fascin thank to a terrif soundtrack which emit velvet forebod , shrill of intrigu and crescendo that tell us of life and death situat that are about to occur . the momentum and the cool of the film , howev , begin to fizzl in the last 30 minut , which featur an over extend shootout where our two desperado tri to make their way off with the ransom money . you can expect lot of bloodlet and an odd denouement . in fact , you may admir this film more than you like it . yet , for the most part , " the way of the gun " stay on target . it feel cool with it element of conspiraci and gunplay , and smart for it invect dialogu and tough guy poetri .
1 robert altman cooki fortun is that rare movi that doe not depend on sentiment to be uplift and to make it viewer feel good . it is a sunni , delight , dreami comedi , fill with love perform , skill direct and top off with an underst , clever , extraordinari script . as this is an ensembl piec , it is forc to start of slowli as it introduc us to it charact , all of them resid in a southern town call holli spring . first we meet willi ( charl s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drink habit . we then see that willi take care of an elder ladi nicknam cooki , who is slowli lose her grip on saniti and is be fill with loneli , despair , and want of her dead husband . we cut to camill ( glenn close ) who is obsess direct a play with her sister cora ( juliann moor ) . then we briefli get acquaint with emma ( liv tyler ) , an appar relat of cooki , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live . we also fleet see emma lover jason ( chris o'donnel ) , an ambiti but far too excit young cop . we are now about one quarter through the two hour pictur , and robert altman decid that it is time to set the plot in motion . we see the ecstat cooki stare hope at a pictur of her husband . she exclaim " here i come ! " and then put a pillow to her face and shoot herself . soon after , her niec camill stop by to get a fruit salad bowl , come upstair , find cooki dead and flip out . convinc that suicid is a disgrac and that she will have none of that in her famili , she eat the suicid note and convinc her slight slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder . she make sure that she stage it like a murder as well ; scatter jewelri all over the floor , break a few cabinet , window and door , and then throw the gun out in the back yard . the onli reason suspect is willi , who immedi get taken into custodi , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn't do it , so the cell stay open and he play scrabbl with the sheriff and the faith emma ) . meanwhil , the unperturb camill continu her none-too-subtl manipul tri to further cover up for the murder while at the same time make her easter play a success . so begin cooki fortun , a film apt describ by critic scott renshaw as " a southern spin on fargo , " except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoy than the coen brother darker , somewhat disturb and slight overr escapad . robert altman slight pictur is in some way reminisc of someth like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both film focus ( on and off ) on the eccentr of the resid in a southern us town . inde , most of the charact in cooki fortun are load of fun to observ , and a portion of them are fascin and surpris multi- dimension . glenn close turn in an insubstanti ( in term of her career ) but magnific perform as the conniv camill and is also the sourc of a good portion of the mani laugh that we enjoy in this movi , and she is perfect cast as the prolif " aunt alexandria " charact , endless obsess with famili digniti . the equal essenti role of willi is handl with an intang grace by veteran thespian charl s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill ) there is noth like a movi which leav you feel all warm and fuzzi insid hour , even day after the film end . cooki fortun is such a movi . i love the light , kindheart approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intens drama the gingerbread man ) took toward the tricki subject matter . i enjoy the talent ensembl cast . i even like the trite " in the south everybodi is relat to everybodi " clich that is inevit employ by the time this movi draw to a close . i'm not sure whi cooki fortun had such an all-around pleas effect on me . perhap it that good ol southern charm .

" while the prinz oeuvr is hard to defend , his talent is not . i first saw him in the independ dark comedi " the hous of yes , " where he gave a subtl , impress perform as the younger brother in one of america freakiest famili . prinz has the act chop ; he just need to take a few support role in some grown-up movi to show the non-believ that he has what it take . " summer catch " certain won't help his case . inoffens , but utter generic , the baseball-rel romant comedi doe littl more than kill time . the stori deal with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthi cape cod girl and ryan ( prinz ) , a local boy from a work class famili who dream of becom a big-tim basebal star . ryan preoccup with his new honey-bunni drive her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazi and endang his posit as pitcher with a cape cod summer leagu team . it a wonder the kid has ani time to pitch , as his time is occupi with make out with tenley , fight with her dad , bond with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserv better than this ) , fight with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carous at a neighborhood bar with his teammat . the filmmak desper want to make a quirki , character-heavi basebal movi like " bull durham , " but haven't got a clue how to get there . and so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minut . the onli bit of origin come from marc bluca in a minor role as a center-field from texa . in an earli barroom scene , bluca , best known as demon-fight riley finn from " buffi the vampir slayer , " hear a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turn to teammat matthew lillard and state , " he doe have a nice ass . a bubbl butt . " when lillard give him an " are you insan ? " look , bluca calm say , " it noth sexual , " then goe on to evalu the hind-end of some other player , includ lillard . speak of ass , prinz doe not bare his in the movi . the actor has a no nuditi claus in his contract , so two stunt-butt were employ for a coupl of semi-nud shot . bluca , whose charact secret date a larg woman throughout the stori , get anoth uniqu moment late in the film . sick of hear teammat make " fat chick " joke , he climb on top of a tabl and loud declar his love of amply-s ladi . while his speech still end up objectifi women , it remain a nice chang of pace in a numb ordinari movi . trivial tidbit : " summer catch " mark a scoobi doo summit . marc bluca appear in " jay and silent bob strike back " as fred from the scoobi doo gang , while freddi prinz jr . play the same charact in the upcom big budget film version of the old cartoon .
0 accord to hitchcock and various other filmmak , isol motel , diner , gas station and similar establish in american southwest can be rather danger place for weari travel . at the begin of eye of the storm , 1991 german- american thriller direct by yuri zeltser , one of such place becom dead for their owner who get murder dure the stick up . ten year later their son steven ( play by bradley gregg ) , who was blind dure the incid , still run motel togeth with his older brother ray ( play by craig sheffer ) . hard anyth happen there until alcohol and abus william gladston ( play by denni hopper ) get strand there with his attract wife sandra ( play by lara flynn boyl ) . their unexpect presenc creat the chain of the event that would end in bloodsh . yuri zeltser , author of this film , was obvious inspir by hitchcock psycho , but he chose to add some new and potenti interest element to the origin plot . instead of norman bate we have two brother - one of them traumatis physic , anoth mental . sexual tension between beauti femal patron and shi motel clerk is heighten with the presenc of alcohol husband . eye of the storm is impress in visual sens , with photographi by karl walter lindenlaub provid a lot of claustrophob atmospher . the act is fine - hopper , gregg and boyl are comfort with their role , but sheffer at time overact his psycho routin . unfortun , eye of the storm , which was suppos to be intens psycholog drama , deterior into cheap and predict slasher flick dure melodramat final . in the end , this film remind us that origin approach can't prevent filmmak from wast too mani opportun .

1 the idea at the center of the devil advoc , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best film of 1997 , is that no matter what decis is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- " the last humanist " . he appear in mani guis , and seduc mani men and women -- in his own word , " vaniti -- by far my favorit sin " . al pacino play this role with relish , and get to chew some delect line ( " lemm givya a piec o' insid wisdom on god . . . " , " i have a million name . . . " ) , as john milton -- the devil . the main idea -- that he can appear as anyon , in ani form ( in this case , a buis man ) , harken main back to terri gilliam the time bandit . but the film , is someth els , someth origin . part of what make it so veri good , is that it never take itself too serious -- it dabbl with moral , vaniti , death , and child abus , but doesn't tri to becom ani profound studi of power . this is a marvel confect -- cocki , funni , thought provok . it is also entertain . there is no way you could possibl predict the end -- it pull back upon itself , draw pure out of the mind eye . the final shot is more creativ , more dare , more challeng , then anyth in cinema sinc the white sock in the coen fargo . the central theme are fascin ( sometim reminisc of jame the turn of the screw , and oat accurs inhabit of the hous of bli ) , and the product that is built around it realli wow . it nice to know that thing like this are still be made .
1 one of the biggest clich of ani serial killer film is also one of the most believ . you know , the one where the detect look at a wall of pictur and other polic inform , and sudden spot the clue which reveal who the killer is . sure , it been use over and over , but for some reason , it is alway fun to watch . this clich pretti much describ the level kiss the girl work on : overus , but alway fun . one of my person rule about watch a film is not how origin the film is , but how it goe around give it stori . this rule appli high to kiss the girl . there is someth psycholog stimul in a well-craft serial killer movi , and kiss the girl is certain well made . howev , the whole film scream of unorigin , and so it reli on the power of it actor and the technic detail to pull it through . well , not onli are the actor capabl of pull it through , but they add so much to the film that near everi flaw is cover up . unfortun , one of the most reveal and rather insult choic by the filmmak ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the open credit . that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was wait for him to appear on screen , which spoil the mysteri . howev , credit must be given to the director for suspend this knowledg through most of the film . plotwis , kiss the girl show almost no origin . we are introduc to detect alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forens psychologist , and immedi we are given the clich scene establish him as the hero . he get a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threaten to kill herself . obvious cross succeed at get the gun , but this scene is quick forgotten dure the next scene . at his hous , cross is told that his neic , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been miss for four day . this provid the motiv for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chanc to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympath with detect cross . howev , what make kiss the girl slight origin is the introduct of one of the abducte . . . befor she is abduct . dr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd famili ) is a smart , athlet woman , and becaus of these trait , becom a target for casanova--what the serial killer like to call himself . becaus of these character-develop scene , we care for mctiernan , make the abduct scene all that more suspens . after be abduct , mctiernan wake up and find herself in a cell somewher in the wood . rememb that the killer gave her certain rule , she decid to break one of them by call out . when casanova come to punish her , she break out and escap by jump over a waterfal . after she is found , she begin to help cross find his neic . from this moment on , kiss the girl take on the form of everi other serial killer film , as the two lead search for the rest of the victim held captiv . mani peopl will compar this film to 1995 seven , anoth killer film star morgan freeman , but i presum that the similar are intent . the screenplay , by david klass , is adapt from the novel written by jame patterson , and yet i don't quit see how this stori could have work in novel form . what make kiss the girl so good is the act and the technic and visual impress . the cinematographi , by aaron schneider , is reminisci of seven , and sometim i felt that mani of the shot were tri too hard to impress us . sometim a simpl shot is the best one . howev , mani of the shot are stun , and unlik seven , most of them take place dure the day , in sunlight . the scene when ashley judd is run through the forest is extrem well done , in more than one way . the camera work is terrif , but the edit make this scene work so well . the chaotic and mtv-type cut give the audienc a sens of confus and unawar , exact what judd charact is experienc . howev , the best aspect of kiss the girl is it actor . morgan freeman is one of today most power and believ actor . detect cross is a veri good charact for him , although it is just a similar one to the charact in seven . becaus of freeman power presenc , he carri half the film by himself . the other half is carri by ashley judd , one of today most promis dramat actress . in fact , her perform is better than freeman , if that is even possibl . her charact is more origin than freeman , and she handl it wonder . we final have a femal charact in a movi like this who doe more than just scream . the support cast is high underdevelop , but the cast member do as much as they can with it . cari elw portray a cop in north carolina , and unfortun has scrap for a charact . toni goldwyn fair slight better , but we don't realli get to know his charact either . gina ravera give a good perform , but again she isn't in mani of the scene . so as a result of all these small support part , the weight of the film lie on the two lead , and they do a phenomen job . some of the best act of this genr , and some of the best act of the year . two other essenti aspect of the film are quit good . director gari fleder doe a good job of control his actor , but the second half of the film lose believ , especi dure the revel of the killer . he also doesn't handl the suspens scene as a better director would have , lose a lot of tension dure mani scene . howev , to his credit , he doe manag a terrif first half . part of the blame fall on david klass . i'm sure the book develop mani of the lesser charact more , but klass focus on the two main part . while this may give the two lead more screentim , mani of the small charact are one-dimension , and the killer , when reveal , is extrem implaus . thank to the smart dialogu adapt from the novel , kiss the girl alway seem intellig . none of the convers are laughabl , and all move the plot forward without seem forc . one of the biggest problem i had with the movi was the motiv of the killer . i blame this main on the cast director , becaus the killer motiv is becaus of reject from women ( or so i assum from the open monologu ) , but the killer himself is veri attract ( one of my friend is a , shall we say , big admir of the killer ) . kiss the girl is rate r for terror , violenc , languag , and suggest sex . with all the implaus of this film , and with the mediocr second half , kiss the girl somehow manag to thorough entertain . in fact , i had the urg to see it again just for the perform . the cinematographi add a lot of mood to the alreadi creepi tone , and the script is usual smart . this is clear one of those movi which reli on the act to pull it through . morgan freeman is possibl today most convinc actor , and ashley judd add anoth notch on her act belt . i must also say that i love the end . the showdown between good and evil was quit tens , and the resolut of the scene make almost anyon cheer . perhap it may not be possibl , but most of the film isn't anyway .
1 the small-scal film , in limit releas , " wake ned devin " is a pleasant excurs to a time and place which allow the audienc to absorb the full textur of a small town . fill with breathtak sceneri , charact , and delight music , the movi would be interest even without a plot . the stori contain sever surpris which are best left unment in a review . the film start out with a sharp open , which give us a tast of what is to follow : countri folk with an inclin for a bit of larceni . what get thing go is the fact that a winner of the lotteri is appar one of the resid in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymor . who that person is , and how to share in the good fortun is the mission of two longtim friend jacki ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelli ) . part detect , part scalawag , they have to stay alert to the chang circumst they face as the stori unfold . the villag consist of sever amus charact . a clueless pig farmer , temporari priest , and a witch . there also the lotto man who must be satisfi that everyth is on the up-and-up . there are no hollywood touch to this film - except for the outer space introduct [ ! ] . pace is right . toward the end , it run a bit out of steam , but that okay becaus for most of the 90 minut we'v been interest in the go on . a mixtur of laugh and ( occasion ) sentiment - all the right emot are engag . in one brief dream sequenc - you'll know it when you see it - a fantast combin of color and music transport the charact to a place you realli hope exist . one of the key moment in the film . the music , avail on cd ( london 289 460 939-2 ) follow the same arc as the movi and is well worth consid . a fine film that for everybodi except action fan . somewhat like the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , ' . . . but liveli .
0 the art of woo attempt to be one of those film like breakfast at tiffani in which the audienc is root for some sweet , vulner , irresist woman to work out her problem and to find happi . the problem is that helen lee who write and direct seem to have written alessa woo ( play by sook-yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulner and she is quit resist . alessa is a young woman who happen to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene . this is some sort of altern world art scene where peopl pay ten of thousand of dollar for paint by talent beginn and dealer in these paint fli back and forth to place like switzerland . one of the most knowledg of the art dealer is alessa . she also happen to be the center of adul of her friend and everi parti has suitor camp outsid her window . next door to alessa move struggl genius artist and nativ american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) . he see that behind the facad that there is realli a sad littl girl within alessa who realli will not be happi with the rich art collector she is date . ben get emot involv with alessa . ( as alessa so delic put it , " we were bosom buddi , now we'r fuck buddi . " ) but alessa will have to decid whether she want love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor . the real problem with the film seem to be helen lee inabl to decid what she want to be say . she undercut near everyth she want us to believ about alessa . alessa is look for financi secur but she make decis about larg sum of money for her client . this appear to be a high profil and well-paid job . we are suppos to care about alessa feel , but she cold refus to visit her own ail father . alessa cannot be portray as sweet and vulner if at an art auction she turn into our man flint . this is a charmless romant comedi that bet everyth it has on the appeal of it main charact and come up double-zero . i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .
1 i guess there are those who have never been kiss befor ( a rare and die breed ) , except if you'r child ? in which case it would be call experi . rarer still are those who have never been kiss befor they reach the twenti . hardest to believ still , is that drew barrymor has never been kiss . despit all these hard to believ tit bit , there are peopl out there who have never truli been kiss , and who are still wait for that right person to give them the wet , sloppi warm feel of tongu intermingl , reassur them that their search for true love is over . well , this movi is about a girl wait for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life . and it sweet . drew barrymor who shone in ? ever after is wonder as ? josi , grossi , the high school dweeb who becas a profession editor , befor be assign by her paper to return to school as an undercov report . it address the issu of how a dweeb , becom a prom queen and find the man of her life all in one sit . hard to believ , but possibl . there may also be those who have been kiss befor , but in fact , never truli been given the kiss . so this movi can be watch by those who are wait for true love or those who are still search for it . either way , it is one enjoy sit , with a fairytal end .
0 paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who drag his violent , sexual aggress aesthet into american film , has never been what i'd consid a thought director ( though some of his film , notabl starship trooper , have been laud as artist achiev ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who manag to , no matter what the budget , make his film distinct and even sometim smuggl stimul theme into the lavish high concept on which he toil . starship trooper was essenti a b-monster movi remak of his enthral dutch war film soldier of orang ( a great film that near imposs to find on video , yet showgirl is everywher ) , in which he cast a troop of stun attract mannequin ; the squar jaw casper van dien and denis richard ( who may actual be 45% silicon ) , in what feel like an american propaganda pictur set to monoton scene of graphic carnag . it not a complet success film , but as a failur it certain an interest ( and most entertain ) one . my favorit verhoeven film were the one he made befor he hit our shore ; spetter , a dark near pornograph come of age film set within the sub-cultur of drag race and the aforement soldier of orang ( haven't yet gotten around to see the 4th man or turkish delight ) . i believ his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satir with a robot hero that as touch as schwarzenegg in t2 . that movi was violent but not in the overdon cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pic . it violenc seem to be there for a purpos , name to creat an atmospher of unpredict dread , not to simpli titil an attent depriv audienc . there a jaw-drop scene within the first ten minut of robocop wherein the lead villain toy with a cop befor snuf him . he tortur the offic by take glee in his victim everi fear tic . it a startl moment of barbar , madden violenc that effect set the tone for the film that could be design as splatter punk-noir . in hollow man kevin bacon brutal slay a dog becaus it just won't shut up , he impal a co-work , drown anoth and so on . but whi ? his charact is introduc as a smug genius , the kind who alway impecc dress and race a sport car while generic rock tune blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheme uber villain from dalla or melros place , though onc the charact becom invis , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychot movi monster . the kind who just won't die . hollow man protagonist are the complet bland but beauti scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , act as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist play by josh brolin who saddl with the film worst line ( " i'v lost cohes again ! " ) . they'r a typic aaron spell coupl , good-look but as vacant as georg w . bush republican nation convent speech ( i . e . bush refer to clinton ; " ? ? ? so much promis ? ? ? but to what end ? to what end ? " -- this actual got applaus ! sudden warren beatti doesn't look so absurd ) . the rest of the film charact are all well past thirti , though act like annoy high school parti anim insult one and other with a seri of strain one-lin ; is it just me or have labor insult becom big budget hollywood new charact develop techniqu ? ahh , what a cynic time we live in ? ? ? as the pictur open we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentr scientist work with the crew of aforement irrit scientist on a top secret ( so top secret the govern has onli provid them with a dilapid warehous in which to perform their extens experiment ) project with the goal to make invis a possibl ( for what purpos is never hint at ) . they'v perform sever experi on anim and have near solv the quandari caus cain , in a twist worthi of the film 1950 late show origin , to impuls experi on himself . cain neglect to let the pentagon in on his plan and somehow get two of his co-work to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead . our mad scientist is turn invis ( after sever fx-heavi complic ) , then he inexplic ( it hint that the process of invis has made the anim into more savag creatur , but this is never explor , and if that was the case whi the hell would anyon be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) begin rape , assault and murder anyon he pleas , alway with a lame wisecrack readi a la freddi krueger . it grow abund clear with each new releas that it verhoeven film that have becom hollow . like the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for human , but in addit to all that it lack ani trace of wit , insight and make no statement other than " audienc will pay for anyth these day " . it an affront to anyon look for someth stimul on an intellectu level , or even those hope to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minut ride . verhoeven has instead serv up an utter routin mad slasher flick with nobodi to root for and no reason to care . the preview make hollow man look like an irresist flick . how can one not have a good time at a film that util state of the art fx to illustr an invis man get down and dirti with his bad self ? a coupl week ago , after see the trailer , a bunch of friend and i got into a long discuss of how invis man flick never go so far as to have the invis individu indulg in their newfound abil . hollow man look like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot . but oh yeah , it is direct by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway . verhoeven deliv the sleazi " good " , but not in a watchabl or thrill disturb manner , here it just feel icki and uncomfort . the director keep his camera train at his nubil actress , caress their breast with his len all while faux-psycho music strain in the background . it plain obvious that verhoeven isn't explor voyeur ( like in the classic peep tom ) but exploit it and not even do that veri well . it funni that with all the technolog $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at tri to figur out how to show a woman nake breast manipul by an invis hand . most vex is that the invis aspect is use simpli as gimmick in yet anoth slasher movi wherein charact do stupid thing just so the villain can pop up for more attack . in fact it larg irrelev that bacon is invis sinc , by the end , most of his potenti victim don infer-r glass that track his bodi heat . as in everi mad slasher film we get the killer pov ( a scene where he spi on his neighbor while she undress trigger unpleas memori of slumber parti massacr ) , and lot of scene where peopl are unknow stalk . the film onli provid one moment that i found genuin creepi . it happen when a lab assist ( kim dicken , who look like she step out of playboy ) in the middl of a chit chat with an invis bacon , sudden paus . " are you look at me ?

1 assum noth . the phrase is perhap one of the most use of the 1990 , as first impress and rumor are hard ever what they seem to be . the phrase especi goe for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delight , funni romant comedi about assumpt and be yourself . novak ( matthew perri ) , a shi , clumsi , chicago base architect , along with open gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliv platt ) , fight for project day in and day out . one of these is the job of restor a popular build for charl newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman . charl immedi take a like to oscar , as he enjoy his person and sens of humor . see oscar as someon he could trust , charl ask him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredict , adventur girl name ami post ( neve campbel ) , who make a live by blow glass . charl want to know who she talk to , what she doe , and where she goe . the point ? to make sure she not see someon els , of cours . oscar glad take the job , and meet ami at an art show of her , and spark fli between the two from the get go . oscar feel he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of be with ami . well , anoth popular phrase of the 90 is " all good thing must come to an end , " and this stay true for oscar as well . charl walk in on ami and oscar have a drink one night , as oscar and ami have becom great friend , but he doesn't seem to mind . whi is this ? he think oscar is gay . he not afraid to share this with him either . oscar stand in shock after the word , " i swear if you weren't gay oscar , i'd have to kill you , " are mutter flamboy from charl mouth . the word spread instant through town . will oscar " come out " of his suppos gay , or will he tell everyon that he isn't ? one would immedi think he would deni the fact , but numer occurr come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he deni the fact , he could lose his job with charl . matthew perri doesn't escap his charact as chandler on the alreadi classic t . v . comedi " friend , " as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shi , and sensit . nonetheless , perri is hilari here , and show that he can handl drama , as obvious , his charact suffer quit a bit here . it wonder to see neve campbel outsid of a horror movi , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcom scream 3 ) as she handl comedi superbl here . her voic , smile , and person are more than perfect for romant comedies- stay with this genr , neve . neve is delight as her conflict charact , who feel love for oscar , but know , base on rumor , that he is gay . as usual , campbel is likabl as her likabl charact . unlik the other two lead here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogu , and is never convinc . when his charact his present , mcdermott set a dull tone to the scene with his horribl act . stick to the t . v . drama , the practic , dylan . the major weak spot in three to tango is the direct of damon santostefano . no origin or techniqu is use whatsoev . three to tango is lucki that the script is so edgi and that perri and campbel are wonder in comedi , or els the film would have been a disast , as it is just plain bore to look at . three to tango is a film done mani time befor , as the plot is suspici close to 1998 the object of my affect , but the plot has never been complet so well . three to tango script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and alin brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funni , deliv not onli origin , hilari gay joke ( not your run of the mill materi ) , but a certain snappi in the dialogu between charact that alway keep you smile . unlik last summer south park : bigger , longer , and uncut and 1997 in & out , three to tango is a comedi in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar . the script is wise to take this rout , as gay can't ( i don't think so , anyway ) be offend by this light , play comedi . ( to prove this , a gay coupl was in the audienc who were laugh constant . ) three to tango climax is a hilari , clever scene that is pure ironi base on the outcom of most romantic-mistaken ident comedi . three to tango is a gem . the bottom line : three to tango is a light , sharp , snappi romant comedi with a superb end , and great star . one of the better romant comedi of 1999 .
1 showgirl is the second major outing for the product team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterha , writer . their last effort , basic instinct , play like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensual that made it come across with a hit like curry-sp tabasco sauc ; a dish not to everyon tast , but certain a well-craft movi . possibl that movi greatest strength was that the most import event happen offstag , prior to the movi , dure the movi , and after the movi . . . and that , after bring all the plotlin togeth neat , it left the viewer with full knowledg of what * would * happen in the charact futur , so there was no need to film it . there was actual about four hour worth of screen stori there , but eszterha found way to get it all on-screen in two , by lead his audienc into analyz what was realli go on ; and by still hold their interest with clever misdirect and fals trail . the major element that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirl . we have attract , sympathet , but still high repel charact ; we have show for the eye and the ear , plotlin that play on sever level , we have beauti delin charact who are drawn from life and veri believ , and we have a stori of an innoc ( who may not be so innoc ) who tri to play straight , tri to improv her station in life , who slip into behav the way those around her do . . . but recov with a flourish , and quit a winner . in this sens , the movi is a bit of a departur for verhoeven , who not known for treat his charact well ; but nomi , the part play by elizabeth berkley , definit opt out of the game in a posit way , and we'r left feel good about her futur . this is not one of the great movi , but it far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negat pre-releas public . verhoeven got his first oscar nomin in 1971 , and in the last quarter-centuri has push farther and farther , experi with the socially-accept limit to movie-mak . his most recent three movi , robocop , total recal , and basic instinct , have been a progress of back-door access to american cultur , move from the fantast through the mere psychot to the under basic drive ; and now he explor the sleez . this movi may be the first movi ever made for which the director contract contain a specif provis that he would not have to deliv an r rate movi . ( verhoeven had to cut sever part of basic instinct to get an r rate , although his origin version is avail on video . ) mani review have taken the politically-correct stanc that ani movi which use nake ladi as sceneri is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movi is not about nake ladi , it about peopl in an environ where nake ladi are common , and whi such an environ should exist . it about the scum who use other peopl as power-trip toy , and the need to escap their power . it about a world where sex is noth and normal human valu don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excit and passion heat in even the most blatant scene is someth of an accomplish . an nc-17 movi which isn't sexual excit say a great deal about the phoni and empti of a social stratum where sex has been rob of ani kind of beauti , power , or valu . the one scene in the movi that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swim pool , is not excit , becaus by then we alreadi know his charact is a callous manipul . if anyth , it a rape scene with a victim who been dupe into cooper . you don't make a movi about the histori of black peopl in america without use a few black actor ; you don't make a movi about world war ii without a few gun go off and a few peopl get kill ; and you don't make a movi about las vega showgirl without show a few las vega showgirl . . . and in an aw lot of vega show , an aw lot of ladi wear veri littl cloth . this is a legitim portray of a rather seami side of the entertain industri , in a town where sex is simpli a negoti commod . showgirl de-glamor the las vega show and sex industri with great effect . nomi is play , in a veri good perform , by elizabeth berkley , who give us a solid pictur of a woman with limit talent who at the end of her rope , desper to live a life better than the one she known . she has noth to market except her bodi and her limit danc abil , and is tri desper not to to be a hooker , tri to be someth better than she seem destin to be . when nomi realiz she gone too far for too littl , she catch herself just in time to save the most essenti part of who she want to be . gina rivera play molli , a dressmak and costum who befriend nomi , provid her with what may be the one solid , posit relationship in nomi entir life . molli is the one who make the differ , and provid the role model and framework nomi need to verifi the valu system she'll be use for the rest of her life , and nomi feel for molli are the spur that forc nomi decis . gina gershon play cristal , an age , but still veri attract star dancer , a reflex competit manipul who becom a villai by intern the etho of the crook and scum around her . gershon play cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fade talent made bitter by self-awar . her charact is veri well drawn and perform ; in a major scene in a hospit room , she acknowledg what she is , and , in essenc , pass the torch to nomi . the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movi , and provid part of the impetus nomi need to follow a differ path . it is no accid that the three import part in this movi are women of differ stripe ; molli is an honest , hard-work person who mean well , and near die becaus she confus the glitter and the imag with realiti . cristal is a talent dancer who compromis her ideal and sold herself to be a co-oper part of the system , exchang self-respect for the speci of stardom that can be had in las vega . nomi believ she can make it without sell herself , succumb to a degre , and then realiz she can make it without sell herself , and doesn't need las vega or it brand of " stardom . " the male part in this movi are simpli prop ; they exist onli to demonstr and explic the cultur milieu against which showgirl exist . kyle maclachlan , whose singl best previous work was as an inhuman emotionless cop in the hidden , give us a nice reptilian bit of pond scum on two leg , camouflag as a nice guy . glenn plummer play a dancer who work as a bellboy , and provid a bit of altern perspect . plummer charact is the onli one in the movi who maintain an interest in danc as a perform art , but even he succumb to the cult of manipul . plummer charact is the closest thing to a sympathet male charact in the whole movi . some of jost vacano cinematographi is fantast , and one particular delin of nomi charact alter , a no-dialog scene use noth but color chang in the light , is utter terrifi . this movi is rate nc-17 due to languag , sexual situat , full frontal nuditi , violenc , and probabl the costum as well . i don't see a way this particular stori could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitim exercis in movie-mak . but don't go see it if you'r not in a tough mood ; the onli person it possibl to like in this movi end up in an i . c . u . on life support , and there is probabl not one charact in this movi you'd enjoy meet in person .
1 seen juli 8 , 1998 at the crossgat cinema 18 , ( albani , ny ) , theater #7 , at 8 : 15 p . m . with my mom use hoyt cinema cash . [theater rate : * * * 1/2 : veri good sound , pictur , and seats] it veri rare that ani medium of entertain can give one an authent , vivid sens of realiti and life . all stori are about select moment of time and place in the charact live , but onli the truli great one are abl to defin their realiti well enough so the audienc can experi it just as the charact do . therefor , " gone with the wind " deserv accolad for it abil to tell the epic stori it doe , in such a craft , intric , and entertain manner . it a crown achiev , not onli in filmmak , but for storytel itself . the film take place in georgia befor , dure , and after the civil war . this play a major factor in the film success . to use such a histor set present mani possibl and problem sinc no one was aliv at the time to verifi it accuraci . it might also seem clich , bore and other such deter factor to potenti viewer . can a stori set so long ago be relat now ? the film confront all these problem , paradox , by not cronfront them . it doesn't simpli plug in the " right thing " at the " right time , " it creat an entir realiti where everyth make sens and said concern are irrelev . build a strong foundat is import to all form of media , without which , what is there to build on ? we'r given some backstori here and learn a littl about our charact , especi our main charact , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beauti southern bell with a will of steel , a cun wit , and a tremend sens of liberti in such an oppress time . she know how her societi work , wherein everyth she doe can and will play a role in the shape of her life and those around her . right from the begin we realiz how determin she is to have her way no matter what the consequ may be . be the most sought-aft woman allow her to manipul men ( and their women ) to ensur she get her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtl ( i . e . get marri just to spite someon ) . the man she claim to love is ashley wilk ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who doe not seem to have the same passion for her as she doe for him . he isn't so arrog and demand as scarlett , in fact , he engag to a woman with a person much more like his . her name is melani ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likabl charact one will ever see . she and scarlett becom veri dear friend , but she never suspect the jealous scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . her meek is both her strongest and weakest characterist - it defin who she is , but doesn't give her much emot self-defens . act a catalyst to the love triangl , and to the stori as a whole is the daper , stong-wil , cun , cocki southern busi and militari man captain rhett butler ( gabl ) . he quit a charact all right - everyon listen to what he has to say even though he got a bad reput . butler make no apolog for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . he tell everyon the much-need truth in the rigid caste-lik societi where freewil doesn't seem to exist , everyth is done out of honor and tradit . for exampl , in his first appear butler tell his fellow southern there no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . this anger them , not for his lack of faith , but becaus he has the gall to say it aloud and boast at that . " do we have ammunit factori ? do we have food ? do we have a navi ? all we have is tobacco . " all true statement and yet the south still insist he wrong . butler is a shifti charact to be sure , but he take such pride in his arrog it appeal . scarlett notic this too when she first see him , and from the look butler give her , we know he not go to stop until he has her . but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and dure a scene which set the stage for the grand stori , butler learn of this and continu to throw it back at scarlett forev . and so the stori goe on , with scarlett be thrown obstacl after obstacl in her life . the conflict she must overcom rang from take care of her entir famili to find a proper husband , especi after she is " mark " for life when her first husband die . this give the film mani opportun to bring in more charact into the epic stori . some are vital for onli a few scene , but their true signifc will endur throughout the film . in most film onli a few charact exist for support in background , but this film is more realist and believ as it incorpor a support cast the size of a small town and everyon has signfic . even peopl in the background seem more than just extra wander the set . the costum design is outstand so that the film make for a real sens of time and place . the filmmak could have easili set more scene indoor and narrowli focus to avoid have to show the outsid , real world , but these type of simpl approach are never taken . the first half of the film depict the traumat experi the south face at the last day of the civil war . fleme is abl to convey the horror of it all by paint an imag of destruct and let the viewer decid just how bad it is . one scene has scarlett work as a nurs at a militari hospit while we hear a soldier in the background scream , " no ! not my leg ! don't cut off my leg ! " anoth scene show her simpli tri to cross a street , but as the camera pull back , we see that her path is block by hundr of wound soldier , but it is their moan that more graphic than all the bloodi gore could ever be . as the second half begin , the film concentr more on scarlett as a complet independ woman who single-hand take care of her famili and melani just to spite the tyrani of the north . she manag to resurrect the famili plantat , but all the willpow she has can't help her when she must pay exuberh tax set by the north after the south ultim defeat . this bring rhett butler back into the pictur and thus begin their torrid love- hate relationship . most of the second half of the film is somehow relat to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . each use the other for person gain , but at the same time they still feel an intim connect with each other . scarlett continu to use her manipul power over men to get what she want and becaus rhett can't help but want her more everi time she tri to one-up him such as marri anoth man and take over his busi . they say opposit attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goe way beyond oppos person , it border on magnet polar . they need each other and know this , yet they never seem truli happi togeth . perhap they mistak love for passion , and the film leav it up to us to make this call . both have thing the other want and vice versa , but when they compromis , is it just to get their own way or becaus they actual care for each other . love and the percept of love are two complet separ thing and throughout the final act of the film , we'r left wonder if rhett and scarlett ever truli love each other and whi . gabl and leigh do have great chemistri , alway leav the viewer wonder which emot were authent and which were manufactur . all ? none ? either way is possibl and it a mysteri that cannot be solv even upon repeat view . it safe to say most of us won't live such over dramat live as those in " gone with the wind , " but it still a masterpiec for it abil to give us a sens that we'v just experienc a life worth of joy and pain .
0 robin hood : men in tight is anoth mel-brooks-produc film in the classic tradit of movi like blaze saddl and young frankenstein . mel brook is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast pace dialogu and sharp wit . unfortun , robin hood : men in tight has none of the easi go humor of blaze saddl , none of the fun act of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spacebal , and is even lack the good , solid dialogu of histori of the world . it is , in short , one of the worst movi i have seen mel brook , or anybodi els , produc . the plot borrow heavili from the well-receiv kevin costner movi of last year , robin hood : princ of thiev . this is not surpris in and of itself , and could have been use to great comic effect , main by parodi scene from the orgin movi . mel brook doe not take advantag of this , howev , and use the film to launch sever idea into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explain later on . the movi scene could be shuffl around in ani order and one would be hard press to notic . cari elw , of princess bride fame , play robin of loxley , a man who was captur in the crusad , fight with king richard . he escap and , join with a man name achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fight in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captur by evil princ john , play by funni comic richard lewi . he also tri for the love of maid marian and attempt to overthrow the evil " sheriff of rottingham " . a good adventur plot that is sad unus . elw and lewi are both excel comic , but the dialogu in the movi is simpli excruci . neither actor has ani good word to work with , and the line simpli aren't funni , nor believ . perhap the worst exampl of this is when the group of merri men encount a man play a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movi home alon . this particular scene is so out of place and so bad act , and follow by so mani other scene of equal miser idea , that i realli felt like leav the theatr . much of the audienc continu to look at their watch throughout , and some left the theatr . chuckl were few and far between , and they most dealt with visual joke ( such as an old , beaten up hors from " rent-a-wreck " ) then from ani dialogu whatsoev . scene that could have been classic , such as the archeri contest , are ruin by poor act . perhap the largest problem with the movi is that it is simpli offens . the basic plot , that robin has receiv a key that will unlock the chastiti belt of maid marian , is not witti nor funni . mel brook as a circumcision-giv rabbi is also offens to me and other in the audienc ( not all jewish , either ) . the movi simpli tri to hard tri to be funni and by and larg fail . the addit of a blind man who stumbl around , fall off cliff , walk into ledg and be a general buffoon could have had some humor potenti , but is also made terribl offens . the onli reason to see this movi is the surpris actor at the end who play king richard . he is well worth wait for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunni dialogu , excruci visual humor , old pun , ancient joke and bad act . if you can't , don't even bother watch this miser film .
0 when the haunt arriv in theater , all i kept hear about was the overdon special effect and the fact that veri often the unseen bump in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesi of special effect . while i agre that this remak of the haunt goe a bit overboard in the visual effect depart , i don't think that they are complet to blame for this movi failur . it appear that some peopl have fail to take into account that the origin haunt had the " unseen " terror , and it was about as scari as a dust bunni . so special effect or not , if the stori isn't the least bit scari , you aren't go to end up with a veri frighten movi . the thing that interest me most about this movi was the caretak of this build play by bruce dern . dern is alway great , and even though he may have had onli about 3 minut of screen time he was still the most interest element of the movi . as i sat through the seem endless , albeit fair impress , special effect , i kept wish that this movi was about dern caretak and not the one dimension charact that popul the cast . never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movi . liam neeson play a scientist who is conduct experi on fear . he decid the best way to get result is to trick a group of fair unstabl individu to spend a few day in a haunt mansion . he trick them into particip by let on that he is conduct an experi on insomnia . and he also fail to mention that the mansion has a reput for strang goings-on . catherin zeta-jon , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subject . like the origin , taylor charact is the star of the movi . but sinc she doesn't quit have the marque power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jon , their part did seem to be a big larger than in the origin . and let face it , probabl half the peopl who see this movi will do so becaus of zeta-jon . i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it . but the real star here is the special effect combin with the fair overdon set . they take over the movi as the supernatur element of the hous start to interact with our hapless insomnia patient . there realli isn't much of a stori here . just endless setup so director jan de bont can showcas all the nifti special effect that he got to play with . and the special effect are great . in mani case they are as good as you are like to see anywher . in other case they are overdon and obvious thrown in just for the sake of hit the " cool shot " quota . at no point in the movi do ani of these thing ever come close to be scari -- funni , mayb . but not scari . then we have the set . when i first saw the hous , i was veri impress with the veri cool gothic look about it . but it onli took a short tour by the charact around the place to see that the set design obvious had as much money to burn as the visual effect peopl did , and decid to take the idiot overdon rout . this includ a flood hallway with book as step stone and a mirror circular room that revolv . what part did these room play in the stori ? absolut none . they were just there to take our mind off the fact that there was neither a descent stori nor a singl scare in the entir movi . then we have the actor . lili taylor has never been one of my favorit . and when the fact that her charact is mousi and pathet is factor in , she come in around the averag or slight below mark . i have no idea whi liam neeson took this role . he basic remind me of the ringmast at an out of control circus . his charact was in charg of this farc but it quick got away from him . i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all print of this movi in a veri secur vault along with all copi of darkman . zeta-jon was cast becaus she is too hot for word . the fact that her charact is bi-sexu is just ice on the cake . all catherin has to do in this movi is look good . fortun that is someth she doe veri well . while she doe have a fair good size part , it is obvious that her onli purpos in the movi was as eye-candi . it too bad someon of her talent wast them here . ani random supermodel pull out of a fashion show could have easili fill her role . the haunt is the antithesi of anoth of 1999 horror movi , the blair witch project . the haunt had a seem limitless effect budget , while blair witch reli on pile of rock for it scare . both prove quit nice that special effect are irrelev to a horror film . if the stori suck , it all downhil from there . my advic ? if you are look for special effect , go rent star war . if it scare you want , rent halloween . either way , it probabl in your best interest to skip the haunt .
1 few film in 1999 have divid the critic consensus as sharpli as alan parker adapt of frank mccourt memoir angela ash . mani dismiss it as an humorless , sentiment , uninterest version of the huge popular novel ; other hail it as a heartfelt , sincer portrait of the human spirit . i'm somewher in between , lean strong toward the latter . it certain well-mad and it never becom tedious like some literari adapt have a tendenc to be . but i have a feel that parker fill the movi with pseudo-lyr shot of rain fall on the home street of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour run time that scream " i'm import ! " mccourt book of the same name was about him and his famili move from the us to ireland in the earli 1900 , a time when most peopl were desper tri to get into the us . as he comment , " we were the onli irishfolk to say goodby to the statu of liberti . " in ireland , frank ( play by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brother , his mother angela ( emili watson ) and his father malachi ( robert carlyl ) get financi help from angela mother , a stereotyp strict cathol who chide her daughter for marri a northern irishman . she help them get a rat-infest apart and malachi goe look for a job . posit are scarc and when he doe final find one , he is unabl to hold on to it becaus of his fond for drink . meanwhil , frank goe to an uptight cathol school , where the instructor beat student with blunt wooden object as often as their heart desir . two of frank brother soon die , crippl by the dread live condit and malnutrit . as if the poverti and the suffer weren't intens enough as it stood , malachi and angela have anoth babi , worsen the situat further . i imagin this doesn't sound like much of a plot . that probabl becaus it isn't one . these are peopl . this is their stori . director alan parker ( the commit ) know how to tell a good stori and angela ash , despit it relentless literari tone remain interest . though the film occasion indulg too much in it gloomili picturesqu irish set , it avoid look like a glorifi travelogu . supplement parker abl direct are the engag , often poignant perform of the lead , some of them season thespian , other relat beginn . carlyl , the charismat british actor who has shown astonish rang by hop from the lead in a rowdi slapstick comedi to the villain in a jame bond movi and now to sentiment melodrama , perfect portray his rather pathet charact . we empath with the guy , but we don't like or admir him . emili watson turn in a heartfelt , sincer support perform . it is most she who implant that lump in our throat . also worthi of mention is littl joe breen , whose face grace the film superb poster . it is breen first featur film and he extraordinari as young frank . not unlik sudden oscar darl haley joel osment of the sixth sens , you can peer into the charact soul through breen sad eye . on the flip side , one thing that could have vast improv angela ash is a more decis editor . while gerri hambl sure make the most of the sceneri , he and parker also leav in at least a half an hour of unnecessari footag . the first half , especi , could have been trim down , bring the film to a more reason run time and do our bladder a favor in the process . thing pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismiss a lot of the critic i accumul dure the open hour , but i maintain that the aggress deliber pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicr unnecessari . * spoiler warn ! skip next paragraph if in suspens ! * the film final messag is somewhat conflict , as franki , in effect , leav his famili famish in ireland while he himself goe back to america . what , exact , are we suppos to make of that ? his mother doesn't seem to mind becaus she want the best possibl futur for her son , as ani mother would , but it still seem inconsider of him . i haven't read the book , but i'm sure that mccourt justifi his action therein ; therefor , i'm suspici . anoth thing that never made clear in the movi is the mean of the titl , which , i'm sure , is also explain in the memoir . if seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adapt , angela ash stand tall . despit a few minor setback , it is a captiv stori of peopl forc to live in the trench by an merciless societi where those of weaker charact are shove to the bottom of the financi ladder .

" inde with a script like that , you could make a wonder parodi , but unfortun the director is take this subject veri serious , attempt to creat a provok an dramat thriller . and for you who have await arnold swartzenegg comeback , will not be veri satisfi . we'v not seen him in a while . that becaus he didn't have a worthi oppon . he has battl nuclear terrorist on earth and power mad conspir on mar . he has taken on alien predat in the darkest reach of the jungl and morph cyberkil that seem noth can stop . so , after all those fight , what left for arnold schwarzenegg ? how about satan ? in my opinion , he has never quit overcom his first role as the dead robot in cameron " termin " . and that is schwartzenegg strength -- muscl and no emot . here he tri to achiev an artist level , move toward the oscar . this is call " an adult turn " if success and " a flop " if unsuccess . make a wild guess ! his charact has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drink problem . this requir at least some act skill . regrett , the onli thing convinc about old arnold is his muscl . the rest of the cast are struggl with their so call charact . the movi is otherwis technic impress , with a solid cinematographi and fine light . but the movi doesn't serv neither as a serious thriller ( becaus of it stupid ) nor as comic entertain ( becaus of it serious tone ) . the onli real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegg tri to cri . the action sequenc are all recycl and the effect are everyth but spectacular . so i realli have a hard time recommend this film to somebodi . unless you are a die-hard schwartzenegg fan , stay away . as for schwarzenegg , he'll be back .
1 i actual am a fan of the origin 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name star hayley mill twice as a pair of twin , separ at birth by divorc parent , never to come in contact with the other so the parent never have to meet again . and everyon should know how i feel about remak , especi of film i happen to enjoy ( my fallaci : unless you'r go to either captur the same exact spirit of the origin or do someth differ with it or mayb even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) . this remak was not origin on the top of my view list , and was actual quit the opposit . contemporari live-action-disney film are not one of my favorti , anyway : they'r usual unfunni , alien , and a big fat bore , at least to anyon over the age of 11 and abov the iq of 10 . this one , howev , is shock not bad . in fact , it actual good . not the origin good , but what great about it is that it doesn't necessarili retread the origin or captur the same exact spirit as it doe becom entertain for the same exact reason the origin was entertain . becaus it cute and innoc fun . becaus it has a pretti killer plot that is endless fun to follow along with . becaus the lead star is immens appeal . becaus the parent are also immens appeal . and ( i'm repeat myself ) becaus it cute and innoc fun . there noth too risqu about it , save the plot ( the idea of separ twin and deni them the truth for year is omin selfish , but that is precis the point of the movi ) , and it aim direct at either kid , adult who want to rememb the origin , or young adult who want to rememb what it was like to be a kid . i , person , am somewher between the second and third . i can vivid rememb when my tast in movi wasn't so weird or divers ( the name godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in everi sunday night for a coupl year to see abc " wonder world of disney , " where they'd show you a live-act and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week . i can rememb my mom take my sister and i along with all my friend and their mother to see all the rereleas disney film ( like " ladi and the tramp " and " pinnochio " ) . and , most sad , i rememb everi singl christma , without fail , there were a barag of children anim half-hour show , made exclus for the christma season , that i wouldn't dare miss . i can even rememb see the made-for-tv " parent trap ii " on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the origin " parent trap . " it more of a late childhood movi , becaus it deal with the issu of divorc , but it deal with it in a disney- version . it play , and witti , and charm , and if i saw it for the first time right now , have never experienc that part of my childhood , i'd probabl dismiss it . i'd probabl do the same for the new version of the same movi if i hadn't seen the origin at such a perfect age . watch it , i could rememb what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorc for me start to get me think about the possibl of my seemingly-perfect parent split up , and how it affect my adolesc . and also how it brush that fear off with a smooth stroke , and point out that even in the most fucked-up of situat , thing could alway work out if you , well , manipul thing a bit , at least for the better . this new version did that for me , but it also charm in it own way . it has a new cast , a contemporari feel , and , for the first time in awhil for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corni or condescend , but just right . the moment that would otherwis seem corni are actual affect in a safe kind of way . and for the first time sinc the origin film , the kid actual know better than the foolish adult . the stori is basic classic by now , repeat almost as mani time as kurosawa " the seven samurai " : a pair of twin ( play here by lindsay lohan , just like they were play by hayley mill in the origin ) are separ at birth by their divorc parent . one , anni , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembl her mother , vanessa redgrav , more than i had ever notic ) in london , where she live with her parent and her devot , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she work as a swingin fashion design . she grow up refin and classi , but also with a keen knowledg in sport and poker-play . the other , halli , is sent to northern california with her father ( denni quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grow up rug yet charm . they both meet at the same camp , one that anni want to go to to becom more rug . they feud becaus they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competit , which result in some nasti prank , which wind them in seclus togeth in a privat , out-of-the-way cabin . there , they becom friend , then learn about eachoth . onc they know everyth , they concoct a scheme to switch place so the one can meet the other parent , whom they'v onli heard of . they learn about eachoth live in detail , they make sure they look alik ( which requir hair cut and , notori , ear-pierc - a scene which is like the kiddi version of the hypoderm needl scene in " pulp fiction " ) , and when the end of summer come , they switch and hope for the best . lindsay lohan doesn't necessarili copi the act style of hayley mill in the origin . but she come off just as appeal as she did onc . she doe , though , add a coupl new thing : she make the california twin a littl more appeal and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotti and proper origin , respect . she also add on an american and british accent to each one , with one fake the other accent throughout , and if you realli take notic , you can see that the fake one accent aren't exact perfect . she also incred appeal , not mere cute , which is especi notabl sinc this is her first featur film , and we know how notori child actor are , especi in their first film . she make a great protagonist , and it onli help that the support cast is equal appeal . denni quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likabl in about a decad - his big dumb smile and near cocki attitud is what has made him a notabl actor in the past , not just that he mr . meg ryan . ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn't ever been this likabl period ) . the two make a win coupl , mayb not so win as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the origin , but they still work for this film . instead of the bicker that ensu in the origin , the film add anoth dimens and anoth angl to their charact that was amiss in the origin : dure the open credit , we see glimps from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quick and mad in love with eachoth , and when back togeth again , the film more smarmi scene come off as actual sentiment , but in that great way , not the migraine-induc way as in mani such film . this all bring this new " parent trap " to a level of entertain that hasn't realli exist sinc , well , the origin film year ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time . this is becaus it has a form of intellig and wit that make such plot point as an otherwis standard villain love interest subplot ( a gold-dig sharon stone type , play by elain hendrix , who delici torment by the twin later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . like the origin , this film transcend all the crap that it veri well could be ( case in point : " it take two " star the olsen twin ) becaus it treat the children as the smart one , and the adult as the silli one , not the other way around . and becaus , abov everyth , it know exact how to be charm without bite off more than it can chew . howev , in comparison with the origin , it could be a bit better . certain scene work well , but not near as well as they work in the origin . i like the way the parent fought over past dilemna and then fought over fall in love again better than i like watch two old flame get back togeth over a bottl of wine - somehow , feud is alway more cinemat and pleas than mere reminsc , a lesson extract from the howard hawks/cari grant film of yesteryear . and as much as this film transcend mere cutedom , compar to the origin , this film almost drown in cutedom . the origin , though not gritti , was far more styliz and just as suitabl for adult audienc as it was for young audienc . as such , this remak may never be near as great or classic as the origin film , but it at least know how to treat it sourc materi with digniti and respect , and how to creat virtual the same effect without border on plager or petti annoy .

1 synopsi : as a respons to accus of sexual prejudic in the arm forc , a femal naval intellig offic is chosen to be a test case . if she can surviv the demand s . e . a . l . train , she will open the way for other women to be permit to follow in her footstep . throw in a lot of polit machin , sabotag , brutal , water and sand and you have an entertain movi . review : the titl of this movi turn me off at first . i mean gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ? the other titl which were consid were more promis - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been accept although navi cross or undisclos are a littl meaningless as far as i'm concern . i went into this movi not like the titl and be one of those peopl who think that demi moor is absolut ghast as an actor . to my surpris i realli enjoy the movi . moor as lieuten jordan o'neil is much more likeabl than her wash out excus for a gusti woman in a few good men . the storylin is simpl . ann bancroft play senat lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push . use femin to achiev polit mileag , she forc the militari power that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the high intens navi s . e . a . l . train . jordan is select due to the fact that she has it all - look , brain and strength . the train is gruell and the indign almost pain to watch . nonetheless , it one of those movi that make me want to cheer out and encourag the hapless hero/heroin along in his/her endeavour . sure , there are the stereotyp element - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resent peer , pain boyfriend and sexist command offic . step away from the stereotyp though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayl tri to get away from be noth more than a brutal screamer . his charact exercis a littl more intellectu rigour than you would normal expect from such a charact . jordan boyfriend royc is also in the militari . although they both start at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen activ servic , he has advanc through the rank much more quick than she has . royc ( what is his surnam ? do we care ? ) almost resent jordan attempt to advanc herself , although he quick settl down to be doe-ey and support . his charact seem to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the militari . in part , this is a veri silli movi , with gratuit line and scene thrown in for effect which are so blatant obvious or contriv that it hard not to cring . i still like it though . weak in the script asid , this is a film which captur a heroic and reckless mood . as we watch jordan battl , it increas clear that it is a person battl . this is an individu fight for self-advanc . we don't have to have our teeth set on edg by didact preach , we don't have to feel uncomfort becaus we'r have ideolog thrust down our throat . it enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person get what she want and we can admir her tenac and determin without come out and say whether we believ women should go into combat or not .
0 teenag have a lot of power in hollywood . everi year countless film will be made target that audienc in particular , and reli on the entir teenag popul to turn out on friday and saturday night , wallet in hand . the formula is veri simpl , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal . you add a high school environ that featur everyon from prom queen to math club nerd , and then a veri simpl relationship conflict that can be work out in 90 minut , the typic teenag attent span . the respons is enorm as this part of the popul will wast it92 money on almost ani = film set in an environ they can relat to , and , most import , they don92t care to judg films=92 qualiti , so ani piec of trash will = due . that is just what never been kiss , the latest film from director raja gosnel , is ; trash . josi geller ( drew barrymor ) is the youngest copi editor in the histori of the chicago sun time . she has her own person assist , unlimit suppli , and her own offic . but she is veri much dismay with her posit in life . there is noth she want more than to be a report and go out into the field , where she can play a more activ role in the chicago media . so when an assign is quit liter thrown at her out of nowher , she jump at it with elat . constant smother josi in the work place is her friend anita ( molli shannon ) and her amic superior , gus ( john c . reilli ) . the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hear the news of her first assign , as they both deem her to be an offic worker and not a report . howev , sinc this film is aim at a teenag audienc with littl patienc for charact conflict , this otherwis interest scenario is resolv within two minut , and josi is head for the field . obvious , the field assign involv a high school . specif , she is to becom an undercov report at a high school , by enrol in the senior class and " becom one of them . " i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the imposs of this situat ever occur , so i won92t . the movi develop into josi tri to find the life that she never led in high school . interwoven flashback scene show us just how much of a dork she truli was , and she appear to be head down that road again . fortun for this lame product , other charact do appear that make some of these high school scene both humor and remot interest . they includ the predict love stori , between both a student ( jeremi jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josi is realli two peopl in one bodi . also , her younger brother and opposit , rob ( david arquett ) come into her new found life and even caus a rare scene that is mild provoc . the humor found in this film is actual quit amus . typic for teenag film , it is chalk full of sexual innuendo and condom humor . one scene in particular featur a certain classroom activ involv banana and latex that is absolut hyster . most of the other joke are straight forward high school humor that anyon who has ever been to high school can appreci and will enjoy . but those still don92t = recov for the total lack of qualiti in this movi . follow this trend of high school movi rule , come the general act . it is even wors than the trend of overplay a scenario from film to film . in this case , drew barrymor is absolut pain to watch . she is requir to play her charact on two level , have some veri black and white transit . and although some scene are written to be particular shade of gray , she seem to hold that color throughout all of her screen time . at one point she is alon with an obvious love interest on a ferri wheel , and is expect to him on an adult level , sinc he is one , her teacher . but she never seem to get out of the gray area , and in do so she make a mockeri out of his otherwis good perform . follow barrymor is the piti molli shannon ( saturday night live ) . she seem to be limit to play an ecstat charact that no one can relat to , and draw the attent of an audienc as simpli unrealist . it is these " qualiti " that prevent the aforement condom scene from be one of the few decent . luckili there is one great perform to emerg out of this otherwis bleak film . david arquett ( scream ) take home the prize for be abl to stand out in an ensembl perform that is absolut pathet , and not have his brilliant act ruin . and as a central charact he get to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done part of never been kiss . in a dazzl cherry-on-the-sunda type piec of work , he doe an absolut hilari tom cruis impress from the 1983 hit , riski busi . never been kiss is a mediocr film at best . the predict plot has becom so overplay in hollywood , that it is sicken to watch time and again , and this film is no except . the act is just as bad , but there is the one posit presenc of david arquett to add some light . unfortun , the bottom line is that the movi will be a success , becaus teenag will pay to see ani trash .
0 2 day in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off . it basic involv how a bunch of quirki charact in the los angel area end up have their live becom intertwin in some veri unusu way . i'm not go into much greater detail than that , sinc it would take forev to explain , and quit frank , i'm not will to spend ani more time on it than the 2 hour that i'v alreadi wast . while it tri veri hard to be pulp fiction , 2 day in the valley fall way short . this is quit a condemn consid the cast includ danni aiello , jame spader and jeff daniel . while the stori isn't much , and the dialogu and charact rate onli margin better , 2 day in the valley doe have a coupl of bright spot . jame spader charact , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way . and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babe teri hatcher and charliz theron ( in her first role ) . you know a movi isn't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women . even if they are both gorgeous . i will give the writer some credit for the fair clever way in which they manag to intersect the live of this group of charact that would have otherwis never interact . but marvel at that ingenu is a far cri from actual enjoy the result . while some of the charact and their respect stori are fair interest , they inevit are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the charact that i realli care absolut noth about . if i were to put a number on it , onli about half of the stori and half the charact in this movi were particular interest or otherwis enjoy to watch . this is the sort of movi that onli a huge fan of one or more of the cast member should rent , and even then prepar for disappoint . not even charliz theron be nake would get me to sit through this movi again . or at least not all of it anyway .
1 so here is the second of 1999 remak of classic horror movi . the first was the dumb , pathet but ok remak of the classic the haunt . now come the high await remak of hous on haunt hill . the classic which star vincent price as a man who pay a group of peopl 100 , 000 to stay in his hous . if they surviv the night they get the money . if not well you get the jurisdict . have not yet seen the film ( dvd on it way ) i wasn't sure if i would realli like the remak . but sure enough it come through and has a great storylin to fall back on . geoffrey rush ( in a fantast role with an incred perform ) is steven price , the owner of an amus park destin to scare the wit out of peopl . his wife evelyn price is throw a parti with her friend . steven dismay at the idea and make his own list . somehow someon , or someth chang that list and five other peopl are invit to the parti . eddi ( tay digg ) an ex-basebal player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assist who can re-wir anyth , melissa ( brigett wilson ) a talk-show host in sort , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallag ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouth humorist in way . what he is gonna do is pay these five peopl 1 , 000 , 000 dollar if they can surviv through the night . if they can they get the money , if not well they don't . the hous on haunt hill use to be an insan asylum . year befor mental patient broke out and kill the dr . there , forc him to lock the place up becaus if he die , so did they . everyon who was in there burn to death . now it is steven price home and he is throw this parti for these five peopl . what start out as a seem normal night , turn into a horrifi , blood splatter night . the deep dark secret of what realli happen in that asylum and whi those guest are actual there are reveal . one-by-on the peopl start to disappear . conspiraci start to turn up , and steven price find out that his hous may be aliv after all . the peopl find room , which onc held mental patient . room which onc had peopl die . room which may still contain these peopl . now these five peopl must tri and surviv the night and tri and surviv the hous , and they must surviv each other with terrorfi result . sinc i offici haven't seen the origin i can't say which is better . i can say howev i like this movi . geoffrey rush give a one in a million perform as the rich steven price , and doe a great job do a vincent price role . famk jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eeri at time . ali carter and tay digg sort of becom the main charact and ali carter who debut in varsiti blue give a fantast perform here as doe tay digg . chris kattan give us great comic relief and the movi contain a lot of comic line . peter ghallag and brigett wilson were great as well and gave command perform as potenti victim . the plot was well conceiv and was veri absorb . the movi has atmospher the whole way through that is disturb and creepi , and even sometim downright scari . i found even the open credit to me a littl omin . one thing i knew not to expect was a haunt type movi with special effect galor . even though it had fantast gore and special effect , the movi has onli a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn show all the way through but you can tell . the movi was written well , and it onli major flaw is the under-develop charact and plot hole that we are left with . the end is quit clever and some may not even get it . i must say hous on haunt hill was a surpris . i was expect anoth haunt with special effect , no scare and a dumb end . instead i found a good halloween movi with gore , scare and great act . hous on haunt hill is one of those movi you realli can't take serious . though it is a well-mad movi with a good storylin it still has some flaw . but besid that the movi is fun , smart and scari and make us wonder whi remak like this can't be made all the time !
1 ( note : there are spoiler regard the film climax ; the elect , of cours ) we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he been unfaith to his wife , lie to and manipul his student , and by the same token they'v demean his masculin , his self-respect , his desper attempt at chang the world . and yet , he equat the caus of his pain , his torment , with traci flick ( rees witherspoon ) . no matter how mani student have come and gone , and disappoint him as an educ , she the real threat . about to give in , and divulg that she won by onli a lone vote , broderick mccalist turn in defeat , see traci euphor celebr in the outsid corridor and say , no . the fact that he simultan lust after her ideolog further illustr that freudian foundat of entitl which all men , no matter how obscur , have in their relationship ; a tradit expect of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbi industri . she can't go higher than him . he won't allow it . and what amaz about " elect " is that everi word of that critic is drawn from a rather opaqu metaphor . earli in the film we learn that traci was romant , and then sexual , involv with a now depart teacher . it like payn and taylor , his co-screenwrit , have taken traci , a girl desper for friendship , loyalti , and almost pervers drawn the mytholog pattern of kid who were so utter reject by their peer , that they found sit at the teacher lunch tabl more fit , to an unlik extrem with her as the protagonist . and it amaz the compass that we have ; it seem so real to us , and not mere becaus it happen befor , splash all over the front page , but , becaus of the all around " nice " persona of these peopl , we easili dismiss the truli wayward deed of the charact . it with mandi barnett " if you'll be the teacher " play winsom over the close credit that payn skewer the tenet of his detractor most ; a final , viscous inject of bittersweet ironi . sexual , though , is not the onli basi for payn satir , or it success . it also make a tell point about polit , friendship , and class boundari . satir is requir ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself serious , or act so , while the audienc doe not . it a fine line to straddl , but some film ignor it altogeth ( " drop dead gorgeous " leap infuri to mind ) . payn and taylor hit the right chord ; their charact are real peopl : neither is perfect , but rather both of the lead are flaw , misguid individu who retain , somewhat , nobl intent at heart . we sympath with them , but still , as a satir , their idiosyncrat behavior , and their wrongdo , is taken to an extrem for the audienc to know chuckl , but also reflect and medit , about . minus half a point , though , for payn admit not to have seen " ferri bueller day off " . whatev .
0 the preview for the movi are pretti good . they show a littl plot , all the charact , and the emot highlight , all splice togeth to give a general impress of the script . unfortun , the full movi add noth but 115 minut . the resid of mysteri love hockey . mysteri and hockey go togeth like texa and high school footbal . the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who guilti of shoot anoth man ( yes , that one of the movi joke . ) everi saturday , the best player pair off for a game , and the whole town come to watch . the town prodig son charli ( hank azaria ) wrote an articl on the week game for sport illustr . mysteri nation fame has the town abuzz . a week later , charli actual show up in person , and he bring with him an offer from the nhl . the new york ranger will come to mysteri to play the local . the mysterian see this as both good and bad . on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibit . on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman joke . the movi follow a hand of live that are affect by the proposit . bieb ( russel crow ) has just been retir from the team and is ask to coach the boy , includ his new replac . he alreadi resent , and to top it off charli has been make eye at his wife . crow is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he just kind of stuck with constant brood . charli , meanwhil , is resent of have born in a town where hockey is the onli measur of a man worth . his " gift " of the featur stori , and of the new york ranger , was his way of compens for not be a better skater . he hope it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeopl find reason to continu dislik him . burt reynold could have been interest as walter , the judg whose courtroom was befoul by a moron juri of hockey fan . walter actual has some experi with collegi hockey , but he activ tri to put it behind him . he want his son to take the game more serious , but he want his communiti to just get over it . reynold could have been good , but sloppi write and/or edit keep walter in the corner , and so reynold never realli get to pull his perform all togeth . one charact actual was interest . bieb wife ( mari mccormack ) , like the judg , understood that there was more to life than hockey . but unlik him she has come to accept the skew view of the communiti . she chose the town and her husband with her eye wide open . her uniqu insight is verbal onc , and it last onli a scene befor it is gone , but her perform carri the hint of some deeper wisdom . mysterti , alaska follow a hand of other charact , but none are well develop or worth mention . the biggest problem with this movi is that there is no real heart to the stori , no under thing that the movi is realli about . instead , roach and screenwrit david e . kelley and sean o'byrn tri to cram the entir human condit into this sport comedi . they tri to make you laugh and cri , to feel outrag and pride . they present the frame and cadenc for joke , but there noth truli funni . they show appropri stage scene of sad , but they give you noth to be realli sad about . as columnist molli ivin would say , it all hat , no cattl . the perfect opportun aris for roach to say what this movi is realli about . there is a funer scene , play with appropri graviti and somber music . it is a chanc for the charact to reflect on their live and decid what truli import . russel crow step forward to speak , about to spell out the movi metaphor for us . he say that what realli matter in life is " communiti . . . . " then add " and hockey . " i guess these mysterian realli are as shallow as they appear . onli mild bad , mysteri , alaska probabl deserv 2 star . i even laugh out loud , genuin laugh in place . but i dock it an extra half star when mike myer , a friend of roach , turn up in a role that didn't suit him . myer is a comic charact actor . he put on mask , becom an outrag caricatur , and is funni . he great as austin power , dr . evil , or ani of his scottish charact . nobodi els in mysterti , alaska is a comic caricatur . all the other peopl have the feel of dramat charact in semi-seri role . for roach to bring in myer for a few cheap laugh show incred contempt toward the rest of his cast , toward his audienc , and inde toward the film itself . it an acknowledg by the director that the film is not worth take serious .
0 fact that charl bronson repres one of the most import movi icon of the 1980s repres one of the biggest and almost tragic ironi of that decad . tragedi lie in the fact that the icon status was earn less by qualiti of his work in movi , but the quantiti . most of those movi were produc by cannon group , compani led by isra produc menahem golan and yoram globus . those two men probabl thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movi mentor of futur hollywood legend . unfortun , that didn't happen , and when cannon final went bankrupt at the end of the decad , behind it stood the huge pile of cinemat garbag , that would requir at least few centuri befor it reach the camp appeal . sad for bronson , that garbag also contain numer movi in which that capabl charact actor and action hero of the 1970s tri to rais their worth simpli by be the main lead , and lower his own reput in process . on the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movi were extrem popular , especi among the audienc 3 or 4 time younger than bronson himself . one of such movi that serious mar bronson reput is death wish 3 , third sequel in the seri which began with death wish in 1974 . in the origin movi , bronson play paul kersey , mild-mann new york architect who turn into dead street vigilant after his famili fell victim to urban violenc . that movi was far from masterpiec ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skill offer the cinemat remedi for veri real diseas of grow crime rate of the time ( on the same line like siegel in dirti harri ) . unfortun , six year later cannon group got right to the charact of paul kersey and began destroy it by pump out sequel ; even the presenc of it origin director didn't stop the rapid declin of the qualiti . death wish 3 begin when kersey come to visit an old friend , live in the urban wasteland of east new york , popul by young crimin and peopl too old or too poor to move out . befor the reunion , kersey friend fall victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( play by gavan o'herlihi , probabl the onli noteworthi role in the film ) . kersey decid to aveng his death and slowli prepar for his crusad , while the polic inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ant to use him as a secret weapon in his lose war against the urban crime . bronson , the main asset in this movi , play the charact who is noth more than an effici kill machin . although bronson charisma doe help in overcom some implaus ( singl man in his 60s and arm with a singl pistol manag to wipe out dozen of oppon with superior firepow ) , the lack of emot or bronson own commit could be seen in a veri few line spoken in a film . the movi author were somewhat awar of that emot shallow , so they ad romant interest for their hero - public defend play by deborah raffin and conveni termin in order to give some more motiv for kersey crusad . on the other hand , emot are much better play by confront law-abid , yet ethnic stereotyp citizen with their daili nemesi of street punk - ruthless enough to exercis their reign of terror on the entir citi block , and stupid enough to be kill in drove by kersey . unfortun , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after tortur the viewer with most uninterest charact and clich and formula situat , end this movi with a bang . the big showdown at the end - that turn east new york into the sarajevo-lik battl zone - is probabl the worst part of the movi , becaus of the poor edit and the cheap set and prop that give away the low budget . in short , this movi could be recommend onli to the most fanat charl bronson fan or for the peopl who are alreadi desper for 1980s nostalgia . ( special note for trekki : marina sirti , the actress who play counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generat could be spot in a small role of portorican wife ) .
1 bruce willi is a type-cast actor . in die hard , he play john mcclain , a rough and tough chicago cop who get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time . again , in pulp fiction , as butch coolidg , an over-the-hil boxer , he step on the wrong guy toe . in luc besson the fifth element , willi play korben dalla , a new york cabbi who take in the wrong passeng at the worst possibl time . a stylish scienc fiction epic , the fifth element complex plot begin right away , in the desert of egypt ( think stargat ) in 1914 . an enorm spacecraft land abov a pyramid where the " 5 element " are store and take them away , vow to return them when the evil come back . cut to present day , which is our futur . the year is 2023 , and new york is the citi . the onli basic differ between besson futurist depict and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker , the build are higher , and the traffic float ! anyway , the " evil " come back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizen of the earth , so back come the tortoise-lik alien to return the " 5 element " to earth , in order to defend themselv against the " evil . " in the process , howev , the ship is intercept by 2 fighter pod and is destroy befor land . when offici arriv at the site , all that remain is a hand . what can you do with a hand ? hey , it the 21st centuri here-dna reconstruct ! this hand turn out to belong to a beauti , but mysteri woman name leeloo ( milla jovovich , daze and confus ) . she escap and , attempt to escap the polic by swan dive off of an enorm skyscrap and crash through the roof of korben float cab . it love at first site , as korben and leeloo elud the lazy-as-alway cop . when leeloo begin mumbl about a cornelius ( ian holm , night fall on manhattan ) , korben search the " yellow page " and deliv her to the door of the good reverend , the onli man who know of her background and duti . now , korben , leeloo , and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruis ship ( special effect were spectacular here ) to find the remain four element . it is here , where they discov that they have been follow by the evil jean-baptist emmanuel zorg ( gari oldman , murder in the first ) . he , too , want possess of the element , as do a group of pig-lik warrior ( think the gamorrean in return of the jedi ) . in a spectacular end , with time run out , leeloo is face with a problem-whi should she save a peopl who live to destroy each other ? the question is a good one , and one that could be ponder . but enough of that . when korben point out his love for her , leeloo is inclin to becom the " 5th element " and save the world from total destruct . the fifth element featur good perform by willi and holm , an excel portray of a comed villain ( who remind me a lot of jack nicholson the joker in batman ) by one of the master of villaini , oldman , and a heartfelt offer by relat newcom jovovich . the support cast , which includ brion jame ( tango & cash ) , tim " tini " lester ( no hold bar ) , luke perri ( buffi the vampir slayer ) , and chris tucker ( friday ) , ad a comed effect to the film . although besson the fifth element can be critic for the outlandish use of clich , it is a solid motion pictur with a definit point . some other director ( like anaconda lui llosa ) should take a lesson from this guy-us idea from epic motion pictur the right way . idea from star war and stargat were util for the improv of this film . sci-fi fan or not , ani movie-lov should see this wonder stylish motion pictur . ,
0 movi like six day , seven night make me mad becaus talent peopl like harrison ford , ann hech , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cent . ? the script was written by michael brown , and he decid that , instead of think up new idea , he'd rehash a lot of clich , omit even the slightest bit of charact develop , and then throw in drug-deal pirat to provid for a few high-level action sequenc and explos . ? there are good script out there that high-profil actor can make ( see the truman show , for instanc ) . ? six day , seven night is simpli a wast . let see . . . we have to get harrison ford and ann hech alon on an island . ? so , how do we do that ? ? well , we'll make her a feisti magazin editor , and we'll make him a crusti old pilot . ? but wait , she has to have a fianc ? e ; that can be david schwimmer . ? but wait , if she has a fianc ? e , how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alon ? ? i know ! ? they'll get to their vacat spot , and then she'll get call back ! ? yessssss ! ? so , they'll crash on the island , and that will be funni for about five minut . ? shuck . oh , i'v got it ! ? we'll throw in a distract subplot in which her fianc ? e has sex with a realli attract woman who act like a bimbo , and then he can feel guilti . ? then , when ann hech kiss harrison ford ( they have to kiss , becaus otherwis nobodi will want to see the movi ) , it will be a vindic action , becaus her fianc ? e will alreadi have cheat on her ! ? then , for no obvious reason , they'll accident run into pirat who tri to kill them . ? oh , yes ! ? i feel so good about this stori . ? instead of use character to propel the event , it will be complet random , and yet total predict ! ? imagin that . don't get me wrong -- six day , seven night is not a bore pictur ; ford and hech both do a great job . ? the spark fli between them , and so most of brown inan dialogu is drown out by the actor sheer forc of talent . ? almost everi scene between them has energi that the perform bring to the screen , and i found myself laugh pretti hard . ? schwimmer is also funni , and manag to milk all of his scene for whatev he can get . ? and reitman , who has made some good film , at least tri to make thing excit . ? even though the pirat subplot is profound dumb , i was prepar to be pleasant sidetrack by the action sequenc . it just when i start to think about the stori that my contempt for this film surfac . ? the pictur feel like it been hack to piec -- i wouldn't be surpris if five or six inept subplot have been edit out complet . ? the one that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a veri audibl groan when they get the first glimps of the pirat ship ) , and i'd just like to shake the produc by the shoulder and scream , " whi did you pick this aw script ! ? " ? the film is outright stupid , but some of the element are subt horrifi . ? for instanc , take the subplot in which the schwimmer charact has sex with the bimbo , and then feel realli guilti . ? this is a serious problem in real life , but six day , seven night reduc ani chanc of complex to a weak plot devic : ? his action are what make it okay for hech to kiss ford . ? in a script that lack even a glimps of intellig subtleti , i find it odd that such a strang insult devic end up in the stori . this is summer movi season , but that doesn't mean our movi have to be dumb . ? 1998 so far has been one of the worst year in recent memori for summer blockbust . ? when i was in line for six day , seven night , i heard the woman in front of me ask for " two ticket to that new harrison ford movi . " ? whi didn't she know the name of the film ? ? i suppos she just didn't care . ? what bother me even more is that the peopl who make these big-budget pictur don't realiz that their film are becom parodi of themselv . ? good actor should sign to good script , and if hollywood insist on make flick to rake in cash , they least they could do is assum that we'd like to spend our money on a stori worth more than ten cent .
0 one of the most blatant obvious sign that often-acclaim director sidney lumet " gloria , " a remak of the 1980 john cassavet film , had absolut no effect on me occur when i was drive home from the theatr . sudden , i realiz that sinc i had stood up from my theatr seat five minut befor , i had not thought onc about the film i had just invest near two hour of my life in . when a movi is over , aren't we suppos to think about it for a while , and have a convers about it with the acquaint we have just watch it with ? i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular pictur by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someon there wouldn't have been anyth to talk about in the first place . to be sure , " gloria " begin with a stir , rather poignant prologu in which a seven-year-old boy famili is brutal gun down by mobster , in search of a disc his father had with incrimin evid on it . right befor the men broke in , of cours , his father gave him the disc to escap with . eventu , the boy , name nicki nunez ( jean-luk figueroa ) , is caught by the mobster , and taken back to their apart . meanwhil , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and return to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremi northam ) to reciev the money he promis her for cover up his crime . when he refus to give it to her , and then hear the group of men talk about kill nicki , she leav with him in order to save his life , but not befor hold the men at gunpoint , steal all of their money , and forc them to strip nude . gloria is the type of fast-talk , smart-mouth new yorker who alway seem to get involv with the wrong peopl , and she never expect to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don't they alway in this type of movi ) and is onli tri to protect the boy , whom she quick begin to form a close bond with . the previous incarn of " gloria " by cassavet and star the lumin gena rowland , remain unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can't realli imagin how this consider dull stori could be transform into an entertain one , regardless of the director or star . there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck close to the origin , but the film itself is simpli lifeless , with onli an occasion laugh pop up here and there so that it isn't complet unbear to watch . i like , for exampl , a veri funni climact sequenc where gloria is decid whether to leav the school she has left the boy at , and keep turn the car around , then drive a littl way , then slam on the brake and turn around again . these bright moment , howev , appear long and far between , and the major of the film deal with the bud relationship between nicki and gloria , which is both pain predict and by-the-numb . throughout , my mind was repeat ask the question , " who realli care ? " as gloria , sharon stone has adopt an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honest doesn't sound realist at all . in the begin , in fact , i was amaz at how amateurish stone perform was , but as the film progress she got better . although not one of her better turn , stone doe have a comic flare that refus to be ignor . jean-luk figeroa was fine as nicki and a littl more natur than the usual child actor who are so precoci they make you want to gag . all other actor who appear were consider wast , none more than cathi moriarti , an entertain actress in her own right , who is bill fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria friend whom she turn to for help . soni , the studio that releas " gloria , " obvious doe not have ani faith in the film , and i don't blame them . they declin to screen the pictur for critic , which is never a good sign , particular with the high-profil peopl involv . although how much money a movi make doe not determin how good it is ( just look at the spectacular " in dream , " which fail to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion " gloria " is go to vanish from theater faster than " ishtar , " judg from the open night 7 : 00 p . m . show i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen peopl present , count myself . although stone can be an impress actress ( just watch her in 1995 " casino " or 1996 " last danc " if you don't believ me ) and sidney lumet can be a respect director , there is no reason for whi they thought the clich stori of " gloria " was worth remak or , for that matter , whi columbia pictur agre to financ it when they could have been make a pictur that actual look like it might have an inkl of a chanc to be success .

' with these word , we are brought into the world of a sultri vampir seductress by the name of lilith silver ( play by eileen dali ) . made into an immort a centuri and a half ago by the sinist ethan blake , she continu to allevi boredom with her state of be . so , what an undead girl to do , except squeez into the tightest fit cloth possibl , get out her gun , seduc a few guy , and kill a few peopl for money and blood ? with that out of the way , let me say this . this film is bad . this film is realli , realli bad . yet somehow , it is strang enjoy . with all the element of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babe , gore , cheesi dialogu , and bad act ? ani casual film viewer would be more inclin to spend their money on rent innoc blood or go to see blade . still , it is consid to be one of the finest british vampir film . agre , it might be , but is far from be the best vampir flick ever . period . razor blade smile has some rather high product valu , shown by the nice overal tone to the film . the film is also a bit of a departur from popular vampir lore , with a vampir that can go out in broad daylight without disintegr , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leav one next to her comput ) , and see religion as the `opium of the peopl ( henc , immun to cross ) . but asid from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film convent . that is , unless that is intent . razor blade smile liter goe for the throat , then pump the wound full of process chees . you can't help but laugh when a femal vampir get decapit and her sever head goe fli into a puddl . you'll laugh even harder at the hideous contriv situat ( to distract two femal guard , lilith toss a cellular phone toward them and dial the number ) . you'll laugh the hardest when a murder wit recant the tale and sudden start sob uncontrol . and then , there the sudden twist end ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) . the film refus to take itself serious , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zip up her skin-tight bodi suit and then unzip it just to show the right amount of cleavag , you'v most like forgotten the main point of the stori . but in case you realli care , she been assign to kill a bunch of peopl who belong to the so-cal illuminati , and she leav a huge mess behind for the polic to find . as much as my critic , this movi work best as a guilti pleasur or as a film that you watch with your friend and within group . almost destin for cult-status , the film campi , cheesi overton actual work toward the film . while this may not necessarili be the film you'd want to be seen watch by yourself , it make for a fun time at the movi .
1 i rent this movi with veri high hope . this movi got prais as one of the best film of 1998 , and unfortun , was not as good as i hope , but was still veri intrigu and thought provok . first of all , the cast for this film is great . tobey maguir and rees witherspoon are the futur of hollywood . they play their role as the parker brother and sister perfect . with a plot as unbeliev as this film , you need chemistri and honest act from your cast . tobey and rees ( bud and mari sue parker ) play their role perfect and display their charact with honesti and believ . william h . maci , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turn in anoth great perform as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a " color " person and his friend , the " non-color " one . he also display believ and must display a certain lack of chemistri with his wife . he doe this perfect and yet again show whi he should be one of the top actor in hollywood . joan allen is equal great as betti parker , the ideal tv mom . her charact is the most ambiti . she is veri na ? ve , and must display this well to make her charact believ and she doe just that . her lack of chemistri with maci , which the role call for , and her develop chemistri with jeff daniel is terrif , and if daniel would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . as said befor , jeff daniel give a bad perform . his charact display the chang go on throughout the town , yet he doe not display it with enough convict . his charact is veri confus and he is not veri believ . this film could have been elev to a whole new level had daniel been abl to give a better perform . the movi is veri provoc . it challeng the issu of racism that exist in the past and that still exist today . i realli was not expect all of the element they brought up , but they pull them off with such flair that it was mind blow . they demonstr the racism issu without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . the onli major flaw in the film besid the perform by daniel is length . some film are not meant to be that long . pleasantvill is one of those film . this film could have been so much better had they not move so slowli to it . first , they are amaz by the implement of color . then they want to have it . then they do not want to . then the war ensu between the color and non-color . this is all strung out over two hour , which was way too long . some movi need a lot of time . save privat ryan was a littl bit under three hour long and i thought it could have use more time . this film is onli two hour long , and seem much longer . length is everyth in film . if you can nail down the perfect time and pace , you can win half the battl . pleasantvill can move at a good pace at time , but it is not consist enough . overal , pleasantvill is a veri pleasant and provoc departur from the predict of most film these day . i went in expect a light-heart film about chang . i left learn an import lesson about racism and the way thing chang . luckili , pleasantvill teach this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audienc . onli if it could have done in a shorter amount of time .
1 ingredi : man with amnesia who wake up want for murder , dark scienc fiction citi control by alien be with mental power . synopsi : what if you woke up one day , and suspect you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experi in a giant space terrarium manipul by intergalact alien zookeep ? in dark citi john murdoch ( rufus sewel ) has this problem . dark citi start out like a 1940s noir amnesia detect mysteri . poor john wake up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner . a mysteri phone call tell him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chase all over town by a murder armi of pale peopl in black trench-coat , as well as by the polic , and the dog inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) . is john a murder , and what can his miss memori tell him ? he search through his own wallet for possibl contact and clue . but when the clue don't fit , it doesn't just confus him ; it caus john to go so far as to question the whole natur of realiti in the dark citi . to john , someth is fishi , and veri unreal about this citi . how come it alway dark , and nobodi seem to rememb what they did this morn ? and how come nobodi seem to rememb how to leav the citi , or how to get to nearbi shell beach ? everi night , around midnight , john notic that the whole citi enter a state of suspend anim , and at this time , creepi alien experiment known as the stranger come out and do nasti thing like inject fake memori into peopl head with big hypoderm needl . the stranger have the abil to tune , ' or warp realiti use telepath power . turn out , the citi is not on earth at all . and the reason whi john doesn't fall victim to the night suspend anim , is becaus he is a human mutat that possess the same god-lik reality-warp abil as the stranger . even with the help of scientist dr . daniel schreber , can john take back the dark citi ? opinion : director alex proya ( he also direct the crow ) mention this in the dark citi press kit : in film , scienc fiction is alway " use to have big spaceship blow up citi . i think we'r a littl tire of that . " accord to director proya , probabl the most interest thing about dark citi is it layer . it design so that you can watch the film over again , and examin it from the perspect of a main charact other than murdoch . it a philosoph piec . cinemat scienc fiction is basic a thin disguis shootout between the good human and the bad alien ( whether they be klingon , giant bug , or propon of the dark side of the forc ) . but scienc fiction in book reach beyond the shoot-em-up level and target the big question , question like who are we ? what is the human condit ? what is ethic ? what would a true human be do ? far from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtl , dark citi not onli featur the showdown between good human and power alien , but it also ask question worthi of film such as brazil or blade runner . dark citi is what philosoph would call an existentialist screenplay . a littl more than 200 year ago , the world was fill with unhappi peasant - - unhappi becaus near everi aspect of their live was control by totalitarian , militari , conformist , mediev regim . the peopl took refug in religion , the idea be that earth life was a time of suffer , but after death , heaven would be avail . meanwhil , the state use these same idea to prop up their regim ; the king was often head of the religion and therefor sanction by heaven . when scienc final overturn religion , the mediev dictatorship came tumbl down and were replac by democrat govern . but the new fear was that the power of scienc and experiment would be use to creat a world order as dark totalitarian as the old . this is the time period when writer and philosoph such as freud , kant , kafka , nietzsch , and dostoevski ponder what societi should be , and what place the individu had in it . the existentialist in particular wrote about the power of the lone individu against what may be a hostil , indiffer , or alien univers . in dark citi , when the last die , defeat alien ask john murdoch whi the alien scientif experi on the human be brain fail , murdoch repli , point to his head , " becaus the human condit isn't locat in here .

1 seen februari 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrow from chris wessel ) . when it come to modern gangster movi , it realli difficult to describ and review them without make comparison to other film of the genr and/or just use the word " routin . " i'v alway subscrib to the philosophi that ani idea ( no matter how mani time it been use befor ) can provid for a good stori and " donni brasco " clinch this idea . it not unlik most of the great film of the genr , yet it never ape anoth style as it has a good layer of authent , even if it core is a tad stale . the film start off in typic fashion by defin it atmospher of new york citi in the late 1970s and the mobster who inhibit it . we meet lefti ( pacino ) , an age wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . he and his associ go through the generic motion you expect to see in crime film like this . somehow he come across donni brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefti and his rep , and even manag to befriend him after lefti was readi to kill him . it clear donni is new to the life and lefti recogn this immedi , tell him all the trick of the trade . i have never seen this techniqu of actual reveal the mafioso idiosyncrasi done befor and for this the film deserv credit . howev , we soon realiz donni is actual joe piston , an fbi agent work undercov - a charact who symbol the viewer as he will soon be purg into the lifestyl and treat as a newcom . the first act work as a guid to ot of rhetor about wiseguy honor , a brief histori of the mob , definit of their slang , and where their money come from and who it goe to . the screenplay is rather sketchi on the detail surround these element , howev , the fact they are mention at all is quit origin . most gangster movi seem to be made with the notion the viewer alreadi know how the mob work ( probabl from watch other gangster movi ) , and although this attitud come across , the film tri to fill in all the hole where and when it can and the effort is appreci . thank the film doesn't becom too caught up in the tedious detail of organ crime , and instead opt for charact develop . much of the stori is told simpli through the interact between lefti and donni . pacino is outstand here as the pathet hood who speak of his job in the same manner ani blue collar worker would . he old and exhaust but seem to enjoy what he doe , just as anyon loyal to the same employ for over 30 year might be . we learn of his accomplish , which are quit impress within their context , and when he complain about not be made top boss , it easi to sympath with him . newel constant play up this aspect , make it a major theme which work well in the long run . as donni is constant impress and even one-up lefti , it hard to tell which emot is more power : the fact donni is get closer to nail the mob ; or the fact lefti has onc again been over shadow . most of the film tell the stori of donni life in mafia , which creat for mani sub-plot and individu conflict , but doesn't alway seem to come togeth as a whole . the storytel is genuin interest throughout , even when the motion the charact go through seem familiar . the reson to donni actual assign vari , he often report back to the fed with detail of his progress , but it doesn't alway seem to have much mean . back home , his wife maggi ( hech ) is readi to divorc him becaus he never a and the famili is suffer . sinc this is base on a true stori i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handl often border on the melodramat . my onli major complaint is the film seem to have no final act , or at least ani real sens of closur . a climax of sort doe occur , but there littl feel of a payoff . we get a happi end , which is good , but perhap a sad end would have been more power . asid from a few minor , general flaw , " donni brasco " manag to be a solid piec of storytel and charact develop . it may be routin , but it good , and that respect .
0 i admit it . i thought arnold schwarzenegg had a knack for comedi when he made twin and true lie . watch him in jingl all the way , i wonder whi anyon ever thought he could carri such a lame movi target at suscept kid . it was one thing to scare the crap out of kid with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parent who let small children see this movi will have to explain theme of violenc , alcohol consumpt , burglari , racism and child molest . and you know they'll burst out in tear when arnold punch one of santa elv . he later deck a reindeer . hey , man , whi don't you just kick the easter bunni in the nut while you'r at it ? jingl all the way is formula crap that follow the if someon fall on his ass , it must be funni school of thought . arnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more time in this movi than a special olymp hockey team , and the movi dredg up more clich and less believ with each success scene . what can you expect from a movi whose entir premis is that two parent can't find a rare toy on christma eve , and will do anyth to get one ? arnold is , of cours , one of the parent , a crack salesman who is never there for his son . he race from the offic to his son karat game , onli to find out he miss it . and his kid distrust him becaus he never around . ( gee , we haven't seen that in a movi befor . ) arnold the absente father becom convinc that the onli way to buy back his son affect is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinn of the hank household choos role like this ) told him to get week ago . so arnold set out to find a turboman , which turn out to be more rare than the tickl me elmo was when jingl all the way came out . let me back up for a minut here -- arnold kid is total obsess with this turboman charact , which is unhealthi beyond belief . watch the show , eat the cereal , sleep on the freakin turboman sheet . i'd tri to discourag ani further obsess myself , lest ani kid see this movi think it a wonder thing to con your dad into race out to buy you ani toy you want . but nooooo , the climax of jingl all the way has arnold dress up as turboman in a parad , exoner himself of all wrongdo in the eye of wife and son , who don't recogn him until the last minut . this is a sad movi all the way through , but it onli get wors after the open scene of arnold and mailman sinbad stamped through a store , race off to the mall and hook up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who run a bootleg toy factori . most pain to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad hold off the cop with a letter bomb after beat up the deejay ( an embarrass martin mull ) who said he was give away a turboman doll . capit has produc some pretti evil thing ( chia pet ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumer is one of the most shame . never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman tri to seduc wilson while arnold is off shop ( " your cooki are incred " ) , it the main plot of the movi that send the messag that it okay to do whatev it take to get your hand on what you want . mayb that what christma is like at the schwarzenegg hous , but not at mine .

0 it difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplish to date are a hand of " award-win " tv commerci , as is the case with bubbl boy director blair hay . that said , hay featur film debut live up to expect , come off main as equal part offens and moron . but occasion , bubbl boy transcend it substandard root with glimmer of humor and scath social commentari . those moment of intellig are deliv most by the film two star , jake gyllenhal as the immuno-defici jimmi and swoosi kurtz as his over-protect , hyper religi , reagan-lov mother . gyllenhal sweet-natur deliveri of jimmi hilari na ? ve narrat serv as the backbon for an otherwis flimsi coming-of-ag stori : jimmi is a bubbl boy , a kid born without immun who could die if he come in contact with a singl germ -- a plight explor more serious in the john travolta tv movi boy in the plastic bubbl and less so on seinfeld . his mom home-school jimmi , fill his head with wild twist conserv propaganda and anti-sexu messag , until he befriend by chloe ( marley shelton ) , the beauti girl next door . jimmi fall in love with chloe , but is afraid that his love will liter kill him , as evidenc in a scene when she drunken tri to enter his bubbl for a kiss . but when chloe decid to marri her high school boyfriend , jimmi build a bubbl suit and embark on a hijinks-addl cross-countri voyag to stop the wed by profess his love . the offens bit have littl to do with jimmi rare handicap ( regardless of what the film protest would have you believ ) , but instead center on outrag racial stereotyp , includ a scream chines strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi . but even if you find stereotyp humor funni , it hard to muster more than a giggl for these shallow gag . they even manag to bungl some potenti great moment with a group of carniv freak . but a few of the harsh jab manag to work , especi in the case of kurtz , who veri blunt show the dark , hypocrit side of the religi right , and a wacki send-up of a cult call " bright 'n shini , " led by the inimit fabio . unfortun , a few giggl can't make bubbl boy the riotous , off-the-wal comedi it so desper want to be . honest , it a mysteri how on earth this movi was ever made , and i'm not just say that becaus it so mediocr . how odd for disney to take a gambl on a film with an unknown director star virtual unknown actor that doesn't seem to appeal to ani particular demograph and has the potenti to offend so mani . and now that the studio is suffer through a veri public protest against the film by the parent of real-lif bubbl boy david philip vetter , mayb disney wonder the same thing . hope the open box offic take make it worthwhil .
0 in 1989 , tim burton took the legendari comic book figur of batman and turn him into a huge box offic hit with an atmospher littl film that creat an utter distinct feel somewher between film noir and the godfath . was it " deep " ? nope . howev it was a perfect entertain and the audienc ate it up . it was natur that roger ebert trash it write that it was " without the comic book uplift " of the indiana jone and superman pictur . which was true . if what you were look for was the tale of a heroic man escadap and adventur you were look in the wrong place . if those film were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberri finn . some critic ( glenn lovel of the san jose mercuri news and peter traver of roll stone ) realiz that it was someth special ; mr . lovel gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that " this is batman as batman should be . " ; mr . traver call it one of the ten best film of the year . the prais was deserv - from start to finish the film was enthral , excit , and superb in everi respect . there was no doubt that there would be a sequel direct by burton . the result was batman return which forget that it want to be fun within the first five minut . the villain ( the hideous penguin and seduct catwoman ) take over , and our epect are alway left unfulfil - when we want the penguin to bite off batman nose he simpli get mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman bodi she get push off a build . i admir mr . burton for tri to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess . noth work out as plan - it fail both to entertain and to enlighten . hint are made to the audienc that this film could be a blast . ala , these are onli hint . there are , don't misunderstand me , sever moment of cinemat genui contain ; catwoman and batman understand eachoth perfect without a word on the subject be said ; christoph lloyd is trap , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is drop into a larg river ; but noth is drawn togeth and burton is unabl to make the film work on ani regular basi . a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman return is sometim dazzl , but to often dissapoint .
0 human quest for knowledg never end . so a team of scientist and film-mak travel to the amazon to search for a legendari indian tribe . the parti consist of anthropologist steven cale ( eric stoltz ) and the camera team consist of terri flore ( jennif lopez ) , danni rich ( ice cube ) , gari dixon ( owen wilson ) , denis kahlberg ( kari wuhrer ) and warren westridg ( jonathan hyde ) . earli on their journey they meet paul saron ( jon voight ) whose boat is stuck on the shore . they agre to give him a ride to the next villag . he claim to know the area well and can be use locat the nativ tribe . veri soon their friendli backfir on the group becaus saron turn out to be a snake hunter without scrupl who onli want to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo . we don't have to wait too long for the giant snake . she just had a panther hor d'oevr and now is look for the main cours . our hero paddl around in the amazona as if it were the pool in their own backyard . no wonder giant anim mistak their splash for a dinner bell . our anaconda is a polit one and swallow the first victim in one big gulp . enjoy ! so much for the first attempt to catch her . but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fish pole ? our villain saron show his soft side when he stop terri from shoot the snake . too bad that anaconda is just about to strangl anoth member of the expedit . one by one she goe after the other . eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the begin and is merci unconci for the rest of the adventur . the rest of the crew keep entertain the viewer although not the way the maker of the movi had plan . howev the scene without the anaconda are rather bore . whenev the lead ladi show up we'r in for a laugh . the snake remind us of a favorit charact of a famous anim movi even if she should be an awe-inspir monster . her attack alway follow the same plan : one last hypnot look - she look at you , kid - then she speedili wrap herself around her victim and start to gush it down . most we don't see the act of devour . but she look nice when she wiggl away with her bulg middl part . whoever did the special effect on this movi may have want to go to a zoo first and studi some real snake . mayb then the anaconda model would have look more real . the animatron are somewhat more believ . but that didn't work for the strangl scene . don't go see the movi for the f/x . they are everyth but up-to-d . the viewer who like to watch the end credit will see to his/her surpris that a snake expert was a consult for the team . we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work . a well known american scienc magazin is also mention in the credit , but i will refrain from name it here to avoid further damag to it reput . the major of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credit start roll , anyway . what kind of audienc is the target group for this movi ? hard to say . this can't be a serious horror movi , or can it ? see for yourself .
0 don't let this movi fool you into believ the romant noir of william shakespear . no one will truli understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work , and this movi make a vain attempt at that . ani move to ? glamoris his life , which hollywood has an annoy tendenc to do , will onli subtract from his achiev rather than expound on his great . this movi about his life , although well written , put too much make-up on a man whose life was probabl more pork and potato , rather than lobster and champagn . oh well , let fantasis onward an assum that he was a bit of a flirtati play-writ , who fall in love with a beauti woman ( gwyneth paltrow ) and from her inspir , sever play develop - ? romeo and juliet , and ? the twelfth night . it is easier for me to believ that he had a wet dream and that how all his play develop , but pleas spare me all of this unnecessari melodrama . but i guess my version probabl wouldn't draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen . so is there ani justif in romanticis the man shakespear , when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul . i think not . as for the oscar were they deserv by this movi ? i think not . in mani aspect ? privat ryan and ? life is beauti were far superior movi , but one should never assum that this should be a criteria for win an oscar , as time and again , for reason unexplain , an undeserv movi will win the accolad . anoth sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best femal lead , over a more polish cate , but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfath die and your nephew be hospitalis - peopl will start feel sorri for you .
0 michael robbin hardbal is quit the cinemat achiev . in about two hour , we get a glanc examin of ghetto life , a funer with a heartfelt eulog , speech about never give up , a cach of cute kid ( includ a fat one with asthma ) , a hard-luck gambler who find salvat in a good woman and a climact " big game , " where the underdog prove to have a bigger bite than anyon ever imagin . all that need is a guy get hit in the nut and a food fight to have the first film sole base on cinemat clich ? s . i can't wait to see the delet scene when it come out on dvd . obvious , hardbal is a strikeout of a movi that never get the bat anywher near the ball . it star keanu reev as the aforement gambler , who seem to owe everi booki in chicago an amount of money that rival the gross nation product of guam . out of solut , he beg his success corpor friend ( the alway welcom mike mcglone ) to lend him $5 , 000 . instead , mcglone offer reev the chanc to help him coach a youth basebal team from the project for a nice week stipend . reev , who want to keep his finger , accept the offer , but discov mcglone is onli too happi to let him handl the team entir . the drowsy-vo protagonist must teach the sassi inner citi kid the basebal basic in a life of absente parent and merciless gang . and mayb , just mayb , they'll play in the big championship game . one of the glorious surpris in the screenplay by john gatin ( summer catch ) , adapt from daniel coyl non-fict book , is that there aren't ani . the movi coast from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombi . that wouldn't be so bad , if the charact had an ounc of subtleti or human to them . most of the kid time is spent yell at each other , talk in slang and act surpris . there littl that natur amus about them , as they all seem to know the camera are roll . the worst of the lot is a tough-talk younger player ( dewayn warren ) whose sole purpos , as the movi unfold , is be an emot pawn , a tactic so utter despic i can't find the right word to express myself . the adult also don't fare well . reev is impress uninspir as the down-on-his-luck loser . the charact is poor written , but reev give anoth charisma-fre perform . everi time he speak , he sound like he just got up from a long nap and is gradual wake up . kid are suppos to ralli around this guy ? dian lane , who co-star as reev obligatori love interest , remain a glow screen presenc ( see my dog skip for better proof ) . it too bad that her role here consist of utter line like , " these kid trust you , and they don't trust anyon ! " then there d . b . sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawk as reev scummi bet buddi and other unorigin charact you'v seen befor and hope never to see again . i want hardbal to be good . robbin varsiti blue was a funni and altern taut tale of texa high school footbal that had ali larter smother in whip cream and jon voight sneer at everyth that move . i haven't seen robbin goofi readi to rumbl in it entireti , but i am intrigu that " macho man " randi savag and martin landau can exist in the same movi without there be serious worldwid repercuss . robbin obvious need to go back to his fort -- make sport movi for guy and not cutesi , cudd pap such as hardbal , which also manag to annoy and insult the audienc . here hope that happen in the immedi futur .
1 you'v got to think twice befor you go see a movi with a titl like maximum risk . the titl is generic . it meaningless . and i can't believ it good busi . when you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you suppos to rememb that the new jean-claud van damm movi , the one that look kind of cool in the trailer and is direct by some chines hot shot , is call , geez , maximum risk ? yuck . the movi itself deserv your attent . for sweet bloodi thrill , this one beat the summer blockbust competit hands-down . onli mission : imposs came close to deliv as skill a thriller , and i'll give maximum risk the edg simpli becaus it not as slick as the tom cruis pictur , and therefor more gratifi in it execut . much to my surpris , van damm continu to develop as a pleasant , unpretenti action hero . his track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegg , but he a hell of a lot more adventur than arnold . in 1993 , van damm work with hong kong premier hardcor action director , john woo , on a fair lame movi call hard target . ( if you can find a bootleg copi , woo radic differ director cut is much better than what was eventu releas . ) this follow-up is direct by ringo lam ( citi on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong film are distinguish action pictur that have consist play second fiddl to woo more operat offer . the surpris here is that maximum risk is a more effect hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo subsequ broken arrow . here the rundown . van damm play a french cop name alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugu anglad ) find a corps that alain exact doubl . turn out alain was separ at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been kill by some russian heavi ( and some strang american look cop ) . alain doe some investig . he find that michael had book a flight to new york citi , and receiv a messag from someon there name alex bohemia . assum michael ident , alain fli to new york and get tangl up with michael girlfriend ( natasha henstridg ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in littl odessa . that as much as you need to know . the stori is adequ , but not over involv -- and the major plot point are basic explain to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . there a love stori , too , but i didn't find it terribl convinc , part becaus ex-model henstridg is too high-strung in her high-profil debut ( she had precious few line as the alien ice queen in speci ) . she great to look at , and she can certain read a line , but what she doe here can't realli be describ as " act . " of cours , " act " isn't realli what she was hire for ( i lost track of whether her shirt come off more often than van damm ) . the movi is except violent , border on gratuiti . ( keep that in mind when plan your date . ) the stunt are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damm stand-in make his work no less impress . there onli so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movi make crisp , effect use of pile-up in a hand of frenzi destruct derbi . and lam has a surpris , innov sens of exact where the camera should go to catch ani bit of action . the main differ between lam and woo , i believ , is that while woo reli on sheer spectacl to gas up his action show piec , lam has figur out more about use cinemat space and double-barrel point of view to make thing run . don't get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soar through space pump bullet out of two pistol and chew on a toothpick with glass and confetti litter the air around him in woo hard-boil , it an amaz moment . but it a moment that hard to reproduc in hollywood . ( for one thing , hollywood doesn't yet have chow yun-fat ! ) while woo hollywood movi look like the work of a talent upstart , maximum risk is a surpris confid pictur . the veri first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the street of a european citi , but lam use of odd camera angl becom more effici later on . the film edit is a particular savvi complement to lam shoot style , accentu rather than amplifi the action . the perform could have use some fine tune ( in particular , there an annoy , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the earli scene who should have been tone down or jettison complet ) , and the movi doesn't alway overcom the limit of it genr . the stori is a littl mundan , although there are some effect moment involv van damm unrequit feel toward the brother he never knew he had . but it not often that hollywood crank out a truli satisfi action pictur , and it doubli surpris that this one should come with a mere whisper of public . van damm fan should treat themselv to what may well be the man best movi , and intern action buff will no doubt savor this flavor hong kong/hollywood hybrid .
1 usual when a blockbust come out , it load with effect , star , bad script , and plenti of action . mysteri men may contain an all-star cast , and efect , but the clever script and charact are what realli work , which is rare to see this year . the film is base upon the comic book seri " the flame carrot " by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super hero tri and fight crime , onli to be out done by the real hero of champion citi , captain amaz ( greg kinnear ) . thing go a littl haywir , when the sinist casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is releas into the citi , where he captur captain amaz , and plan to wreak havoc upon champion citi . well , the trio decid to take matter in their own hand , by save the citi , but first they need some assit . this is where the film take a turn for the better . in the beggin , there were onli 3 wanna be hero . " blue raja ( hank azaria ) , " mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and " the shovel ( william h . maci ) . sure they were enteratain , but their act grew old fast . that is until they aquir " invis boy " ( kel mitchel ) , and " the bowler " ( janean garafalo ) and " mr . splein " ( paul reuben ) , 2 of which rescu the film from becom a disastor mess . thank , the origin 3 hero becom amus , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . the whole premis is rather ridicul , but pack a few punch to keep interest . for one , the film is consider clever . it liter poke fun at super hero film , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , mani scene are similar to batman and robin , includ the open sequenc , onli alter in a humor and superior way . a part of the clever come from the cast . sometim a film with such talent is overblown , but the act is what keep it aliv here . while azaria and maci were enteratin , 2 charact realli stood out . one was paul reuben . no matter how disgust or revolt " mr . splein " may be , you still can't help but laugh . it so incred moron , it just a riot watch reuben reliev himself of bodili function . janean garafalo also was an interest charact . she seem to be the most outgo and convinc charact on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flow . men is worth see alon , for those 2 troubl hero . on the downsid , a few of the hero and especi the villain never realli lift off . kel mitchel and geoffrey rush , were both utter useless . their part were so limit , they'd be lucki at all to be on screen for more than 20 minut . ben stiller too was wast , most becaus of his unlik power and dialogu . none of these charact get a rise out of anybodi , but happili they are lost in the charm flow of the film . as far as the budget goe , it was wise spent on the cast , not the effect . while the set design and action all look nice , i'm glad there was a seper aspect , that the film focus on , and for that i applaud . slow at time , and rather pointless , mysteri men still deliv . it forget about money make , becaus it not like to make a bundl like it proceed , and that what work . stupid ? mayb , but for onc i'm not disappoint . no one expect an intellig film , but you get a film that wit captur your attent and make you forget this miser year .
1 billi bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996 sling blade after spend year as a virtual unknown actor and writer , is becom one of the most versatil - and most accomplish - american actor around at the moment . as jacob , the simpl but at time veri bright loser brother of bill paxton hank , thornton give a perform which should leav an indel mark on all but the most harden viewer . three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent brisco ) stumbl upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspect , yield a rot corps and a bag full of money . jacob and lou want to pocket the cash . hank , the smarter - and perhap more naiv - of the three , insist on leav the money for the author to find . eventu , they agre to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three way . thing start go wrong , though , with greed and violenc weav their way through their plan . disast is sure to strike . director sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excel and thought-provok film , world away from the comic horror film which made his name . while there are a coupl of moment which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intellig and matur departur which will hope be a sign of even greater film to come . scott b . smith screenplay , base on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine exampl of escal tension . while it doe remind one of danni boyl shallow grave without the abund of black humour , it keep the drama that should realli be a part of such a stori on moral , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter . alar kivilo cinematographi remind one of joel and ethan coen fargo , with the bleak , snowi landscap almost becom anoth charact . danni elfman also doe well with his moodi , finely-written score . if there a flaw in the film , it that it goe on for just a littl too long . just when we think that they are about to wrap thing up , raimi and smith decid to let the film go on a littl further . while this isn't realli a bad thing , it did becom a littl frustrat at time ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consum a larg sprite beforehand ) . the perform are excel , with the usual annoy paxton in fine form and bridget fonda give a scene-st turn as hank scheme wife . this is an excel showcas for thornton fine skill as an actor and a great chang in direct for raimi , who could veri well have a career ahead of him as an accomplish director of dramat film . finger cross , though , that this doesn't stop him from make anoth evil dead sequel .
0 note : some may consid portion of the follow text to be spoiler . be forewarn . it rather easi to start tune out after about twenti minut of finn taylor first featur film , dream with the fish , when the plod , tedious open sequenc final pay off with a potenti provoc setup . ani hope expect , howev , are soon vanquish as the film settl upon be an uninvolv mismatched-buddi movi which is rare as funni as it aspir to be nor near as affect as it eventu strive to be in the film latter half . the film central charact are terri ( david arquett ) , a depress , lone voyeur who claim to be despond sinc the death of his wife in an automobil accid , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefre young street tough later reveal to be termin ill . nick live in the apart build across from terri , who spi on the tryst between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erb ) with his trusti set of binocular , but the two young men first formal meet at the bay bridg where a half-drunk terri precari teeter upon the edg , unconvinc vow suicid . nick casual ask for terri wristwatch , and eventu con terri into a trade - the watch for a bottl of pill . of cours , terri find that the pill do not end up have the presum lethal effect , and he angrili set out to find nick in order to retriev his watch . learn of nick condit ( he onli has a hand of week left ) , terri compass kick in , and the two eventu come to a distinct peculiar arrang - terri will agre to bankrol the die nick lifelong fantasi , and nick will fulfil terri death wish by kill him . this is a promis premis , and mr . taylor film could have gone ani number of ambiti way from this point , but he instead choos to capitalis upon the obvious invers of the charact ( terri is a repess , mourn charact who want to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivr who is die but want to live ) and take the easi rout out by turn dream with the fish into a typic lark where the two charact engag in a seri of general dull exploit , and where the straight-lac charact learn to enjoy and ppreciat life when hook up with a quirki charact . this is by-the-numb plot , buddi movie/road movi redux . howev , dream with the fish is most hamper not by it uninspir storylin , but by the charact which carri the stori - it help in such a film to have at least one of the protagonist be at least somewhat empathet , if not likeabl . unfortun , that is not the case here , where both of the film lead charact are thoroug uninterest and annoy , give the audienc veri littl to sympathis with their respect plight , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploit . far from a romp , this fatal flaw make dream with fish more like a chore to endur than a play jaunt , and undermin the attempt at emot reson in the latter stage of the film as the two men begin to bond . mr . taylor dialogu sporad fall flat in dream with the fish - while attempt to captur a quirki and clever tone , it too often come across instead as hopeless contriv ( wit such line as " you should have ask someth more interest , like do you enjoy the pain ? ' - see , that provoc , leav room for further question . " ) the film enjoy a few inspir moment - the urn scene , a session of nude bowl , the policeman join in on terri and nick acid trip - but unfortunatet these instanc are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fish regist more as attempt rather than actual success . this occur particular often dure the film open sequenc - as terri is wrestl the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospit , i'm realis that this is * intend * to be funni , although nari a smile crept upon my lip - which is probabl due to the obvious fact that it pain clear to the audienc from the outset that terri is go to be thwart in his initi suicid attempt , sap ani element of surpris or amus from nick scheme of trick him ; this is not a film which has the wherewith to kill off it lead star in the open ten minut . the entir sequenc is , then , clear an exercis for charact exposit , with attempt at humour terribl diminish by utter predict . among the cast , come off best is david arquett , the current master in the portray of meek , squirm , stammer fresh-fac charact - he would have been terrif as the lead for georg huang swim with shark - who get to appli his adept for timid as terri . mr . taylor ambiti employ an interest visual techniqu , where the portion of the film set in an urban environ have been process to appear extrem graini and heavili satur , as oppos to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scene . the charg of dream with the fish protagonist be wholli unempathet is a bit of an odd one come from me ; i seem to have a predilect for film with unlik charact , and inde , in mani case have i been in the minor , support film which have been condemn as intermin due to the difficult , audience-unfriend natur of their charact . for dream with the fish , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hope that the film would quick conclud , and that the nick charact would just hurri up and die .
0 make your first featur film ain't easi . assembl a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eye king , and you'r alreadi ahead of the game . but rehash old plot line , tire dialogu , and standard clich ? s , and a well-intent effort such as this one could jeopard your chanc at a second featur film . how mani more movi do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friend hopeless turn to crime or wors ? the enorm catalog of such movi might dissuad a filmmak from make yet anoth , but here we have it . again . five irish kid in nyc hell kitchen make an overemot pact over some stolen ring on an anonym rooftop . with teari music . and slow motion . in the film first scene . the kid grow up to be fair worthless adult , unabl or unwil to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen . lead the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-heart guy who watch out for his buddi and is in tight with local mob head armand assant . i'd like to say that his charact get involv over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are littl tast of possibl plot point . he concern about buddi jason gedrick heroin abus . he stick up for jim breuer after he impregn baldwin charact sister . he look into who might be push the most moronic-look counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuin funni touch ) . but none of this ever realli amount to anyth . it seem that moresco greater concern is to provid that intang " slice of life " , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyon been tri to evok sinc scorses earli work . so , we get the drunk guy , hug and sing togeth at the local bar , to prove to us that they realli love each other . ( do peopl actual do this ! ? ) we get a lot of tough street talk -- usual mumbl for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sound like it fit or not . we also get a hand of good actor in small role that seem to lack purpos . bruno kirbi , chazz palminteri , you know , guy you'v seen in movi just like this one befor . assant is intellig cast as the man that everyon fear , and baldwin perform is adequ , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thorough that it almost funni . moresco , a theater guy and sometim tv writer ( includ the seri falcon ) , obvious labor over this one as anyon might a first child , but the content is probabl too person . as a result , the movi style is heavy-hand , in need of a consider amount of tone down . near everi time an action by the grown up gang recal someth they did as kid , moresco remind us -- boy doe he remind us . with slow dissolv to the earlier scene , run in slow motion , complet with dialogu from the present , just in case we don't comprehend the link to the past . moresco need to either trust his audienc intellig , or have more faith in his own present rather than beat us over the head with it . his next project should have a littl more person distanc , and a lot more subtleti . if he actual get that chanc . review as part of our 2001 boston film festiv coverag ( featur stori come soon ) .
1 i can hear the question alreadi . what on earth do these two movi have in common ? to most peopl , not a lot , except that both are by renown director . as i saw them , howev , both movi have flaw romant script wrap in distinct packag of lavish visual music number . but oh , how differ the packag affect their film . while " everyon " product number make an otherwis ordinari woodi tale someth special , jane campion imagin visual onli serv to emphas how pompous and uninvolv laura jone script is . i left " everyon say i love you " not rememb a lot about who love whom , but it infecti happi put a grin on my face . i left " the portrait of a ladi " not rememb a lot about who love whom , and i could have care less . " everyon " featur noth allen hasn't done befor storywis . woodi is again desper in love with a beauti woman ( robert ) , and against the odd they manag to click for awhil befor allen is left wonder what went wrong--again . similar situat happen to his famili and friend . some of the more outlandish comedi scene even hark back to his " earli , funni " film . the scene between tim roth and drew barrymor could have come out of " take the money and run , " his directori debut . howev , noth allen has ever done prepar me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirit . in fact , in this movi , the feel itself is what most import . yes , the movi would have been better--among his veri best , i think--if it had a meatier stori . but what it lack in substanc it make up for in feel . and what better way to express feel than through music ? love is often best express in a song , and the number the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . some are a tad too goofi , such as the number where a lot of ghost pranc around in a funer parlor , but i admir allen for even put them in there . it also help that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast work with him . their sing voic rang from quit good ( goldi hawn ) to not quit good ( allen ) to liter unlisten ( barrymor , whose real voic was dub by a profession ) . but while their vocal abil differ , all the actor do a great job of put joy up there on the screen , and make it rub off on the audienc . grant , some peopl will simpli never accept charact sing in movi , but for those attun to it , this film should work wonder . jane campion , too , has a top-flight cast work for her in " portrait of a ladi , " too , but even their consider skill can do noth to keep the film from be a stilt , virtual lifeless mess , albeit a visual interest one . campion and her cinematograph stuart dryburgh come up with a great varieti of eye-fil imag that linger in the mind . unfortun , what didn't linger in the mind for me was the stori the visual were suppos to be reflect . i rememb veri well shot of a train with it light beam and shot of men vanish around nicol kidman , but i can rememb veri littl of what happen between all these peopl . even wors , i don't find myself feel bad that i'v forgotten . the problem , i think , lie not with the cast , which seem to be tri veri hard for the materi . it was the script that couldn't convinc me to care about anyon . the charact were put out all kind of emot , but i found no reason to connect with ani of them . i understood that the stori was about cold , emot vacant charact , but for me to care about them , i have to identifi with them somehow and want them to inject feel into their live . jone script never simpli gave me that opportun . in the end , it almost seem as if campion was tri to inject some life of her own into the proceed with her visual flourish . unfortun , as she kept paint these dazzl pictur , they onli serv to push me further away from the materi and remind me that there was no connect between me and the film . in the end , the movi one strength end up hurt it . so here we have two film with pretti uninterest plot , and yet i was abl to truli enjoy one of them . whi ? with both film , my head care about neither stori , but onli " everyon say i love you " was abl to make my heart sing .
1 contact is a film that tri to do sever differ thing . it is intend to present a realist pictur of what alien contact might be like , to restor a sens of wonder and mysteri to the issu of extraterrestri life , to rais question about scienc and faith and how they would be relev in such a situat , and to tell a person stori of a romanc between the astronom dr . elli arroway ( jodi foster ) and the religi spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . the film succeed wonder at it first two goal . the portray of the communic from an alien world is much more reason ( albeit less immedi engag ) than , say , the cold-blood destruct of the invad in independ day or even the complex process of abduct and genet hybrid that form the ongo plot line of tv the x-file . the alien in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anyth els . they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communic in person . the film wise refrain from show us the alien direct , and between the charact ongo specul about the extraterrestri and the outstand visual in the climact yet enigmat scene when arroway arriv on the alien world , that sens of wonder and mysteri come through with a forc rare seen sinc stanley kubrick 2001 : a space odyssey . most of the film , howev , take place on earth , where there is an extend public debat on how to respond to these alien . scientist are enthusiast , ultraconserv religi leader are wari , and govern offici are caught somewher in between . the debat is fuel larg by dr . arroway atheism ; she seem the obvious choic to pilot the spacecraft for which the alien have provid blueprint , but mani are wari of send an atheist as humankind repres to anoth speci . the film is part success in rais and explor these question , especi when it reach a conclus that suggest that the two approach - scienc and faith - could be view as complementari rather than diametr oppos . still , the film fall a littl short in it represent of this conflict as it exist in american societi . the two " side " are repres primarili by arroway and by far-right fundamentalist , but in realiti probabl 80% of american are neither atheist nor far-right fundamentalist . palmer joss occupi someth of a middl ground , but he ultim becom distract by person motiv and come across as a less-than-id spokesman for ani ideolog . then again , the film doe concentr most on public debat , which doe , after all , tend to be domin by extremist , rather than on dinner-t or college-dormitori discuss . contact is accur in it portray of these issu , then , but onli within the narrow scope to which it confin itself . the film one clear failur is in the portray of the romanc between arroway and joss . for one thing , it resort to the tire movi clich * that two attract peopl will immedi fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen togeth , as there doe not seem to be ani other reason for their instant mutual attract . the romanc rare , if ever , shed ani light on the charact , although it occasion tri and fail - joss explan that he quit the priesthood becaus of the celibaci requir ( " i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth " ) , for exampl , is more like a punchlin to a joke than charact develop . instead , the romanc most seem to exist for the sake of later plot develop . grant , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the charact are secondari , but this just seem like lazi on the writer part more than anyth els . the success of contact , howev , far outweigh it failur . even if the social commentari had fizzl altogeth ( which it didn't ) , the simpl yet mysteri stori of alien communic still would have made it a memor film . contact doesn't quit cover all the base , but it cover about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and it reject of big-budget theatric for a more realist stori is certain admir . and i would not be surpris if , ten year from now , contact is mention in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest exampl of sophist and intellectu relev scienc fiction .
0 it a sad state of affair when the back box blurb is more excit than the movi contain within it . such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_ . though the blurb allud to " a jungl fill with polit intrigu , uneasi allianc , and murder enemi at everi turn , " the stori of the movi is actual quit simpl ( and prosaic ) : a middle-ag japanes businessman name endo ( play by john fujioka ) and his assist , both of whom have samurai aspir , travel to africa in search of his ancestor , who went to bring buddhism to africa . he hire the servic of down-at-the-heel vietnam veteran pilot johnni congo ( the redoubt lanc henriksen ) and his girlfriend ( arabella holzbog ) , and travel to the camp of an arms-merchant-cum-safari-host- cum-islamic-missionari ( john saxon ) and his wife ( lisa eilbach ) . they are all kidnap by an african revolutionari guerilla with witch-doctor aspir to conceal a pre-arrang arm deal , which subsequ fall through . congo escap , find endo ancestor sword , and come back , gun blaze , to free the rest of them , and endo kill the revolutionari with the sword . the end . _the last samurai_ is one of those movi that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoy . it is mere _there_ . the murki plot is fill with subtext that are never elabor , subplot that are never explain , and mani scene that make veri littl sens at all . the film is shot through with all the tire old " inscrut japanes samurai " and zen stereotyp that are to be expect from an american movi . it is quit slow-pac , with onli a bit of action near the end , and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quit anticlimact . most of the act is fair , with the possibl except of congo girlfriend . lanc henriksen is his usual scene-chew self , and is one of few possibl reason anyon might conceiv have for see this movi . the onli other bright spot is the sweep african sceneri . i paid $3 for this film , from the discount rack at best buy , and halfway suspect i overpaid for it . if you are in the mood for samurai , read a clavel novel or watch a kurusawa movi . skip _the last samurai_ unless you are a die-hard henriksen fan .
1 there is a strike scene earli in " citi of angel , " where all the angel who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . the camera move abov them , show the endless row of ether men and women , all garb in black . then the camera move in on the face of seth , an angel play by nicola cage , and as the sun rise , he smile and his entir face light up . you see , the angel can hear music in sunris and sunset , but they cannot feel a human touch . it is an import scene for sever reason . first of all , it is one of mani instanc in the film that make angel seem thorough plausibl . the film present these fantast be as normal-look peopl who drift amongst the inhabit of earth , watch what goe on with littl interfer . there are none of the standard , hokey angel refer use in recent film like " angel in the outfield " ( 1994 ) or " michael " ( 1996 ) . the angel here are stark and believ . this earli scene on the beach is also an import scene of juxtaposit , for it show how god angel can enjoy aspect of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are deni so mani simpl human pleasur , like feel the sand on their feet or the wave lap at their leg , or the smell of the salt in the air . there is an inher tragedi in be an angel , although there is much beauti in it as well . they etern walk the earth , listen to our thought , touch us in our pain , and lead the die to heaven . like human exist , be an angel is often confus and unsur . " citi of angel " is essenti a love stori , between seth and a human , a beauti but sad heart surgeon name maggi ( meg ryan ) . he first see her when he is in her oper room , wait to lead the soul of her die patient to heaven . maggi is distraught , do everyth in her power to stop the man from die on her tabl , and seth is move by her effort and , more import , her overwhelm sad when the patient die . angel have the limit power to sooth human in time of miseri and pain , and seth doe what he can with his invis touch , but it not enough . he want to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distanc . he learn that the onli way to fulfil his desir for human love and touch is for him to " fall " and becom human . he learn this from anoth fallen angel , play by denni franz ( " n . y . p . d . blue " ) in a touch and humor perform . sit at a diner togeth , franz tell cage charact about how wonder it is to be human - to be abl to tast food , feel anoth person skin , smell the air , and most import , have a love wife and children . of cours , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . " citi of angel " is someth of a reinterpret of wim wender haunt 1988 film " wing of desir . " wender film was more like a poem - it was the feel , the emot that truli matter over what actual happen . the american version move the locat from divid berlin to broken los angel , and the emphasi shift onto the relationship between the immort angel and the mortal human . and , unlik most foreign film that are re-mad into hollywood fare , it doesn't suffer extens damag . this may be becaus director brad silberl ( " casper " ) and screenwrit dana steven ( " blink " ) want to make " citi of angel " it own movi - inspir by " wing of desir , " but not an attempt to copi it . and yet , " citi of angel " is not a typic hollywood movi . it is beauti film in lush color by cinematograph john seal ( " the english patient " ) , whose sweep aerial shot and golden light make los angel into an almost unrecogniz new world . seal creat mani strike visual : in addit to the beach scene , there is a wonder sequenc in a circular librari where all the angel appear at banist all around , look down at seth as he watch maggi walk by . while the film travel along a chart plot , it take time to develop it charact and situat ; it shed light on the boundari between what is earth and what is heaven , and show just how thin those boundari are . both cage and ryan give soul , soft-spoken perform . ryan , who is usual so bounci and energet , truli embodi a sad that can onli be allevi by a heaven touch . cage project all his desir and long to be human in simpl , heartfelt gaze , and speak with the comfort , know voic that onli an angel could have . what is most strike about " citi of angel " is that steven has ad a new end to the screenplay , which is both unexpect and challeng . it not a formula hollywood end , becaus it is both sad and uplift at the same time . it doesn't give the audienc what it think it want at the end of a romanc . instead , it offer someth much better , someth that speak to the depth of what it mean to be human and aliv . ____________________________________________ visit " charli don't surf !

1 all those who were offend by there someth about mari should not tread in the water of american pie , a gratuit sexual rollercoast ride of raunch . and while this uproari funni , gross-out summer movi is basic an exercis in bad tast , it also demonstr a surpris sweet in the end . american pie is the latest entri to the offens teenage-target fare this season . i must question the studio that releas a movi like this . the produc are aim these film at the 15-24 crowd , but while push the limit of possibl sex and violenc in an r-rate film . some have even been narrowli avoid the dread nc-17 , a rate the mpaa give when the adult content surpass even that of a restrict movi . american pie was threaten with an nc-17 , but after snip a few scene from the finish product , it was given an r . but at least this new addit is not as careless and unforgiv as someth like south park . it is sick , pervers , and ultim disgust - not to mention extrem funni . american pie is about four desper teenag who make a pact to lose their virgin by prom night . jim ( jason bigg ) , kevin ( thoma ian nichola ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddi kay thoma ) are a quartet of high school student in their senior year who think sex is someth they must experi to be success in their live ahead . jim inquir what it feel like when you reach third base , to which one of his friend repli : `like warm appl pie . . . ' . of cours , this prompt the scene unfair expos in the trailer , in which jim and a fresh bake pie have a veri intim moment in the kitchen corner . there are mani moment , such as this , in which director paul weitz use a game-plan similar to the one frequent display in mari : to caus the audienc to break down laugh in disgust disbelief . american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenish reward if you manag to stick with it . i love the young cast in this movi . consid the subject matter that these actor have dealt with , obvious suggest never rival in ani of their previous project , and you should appreci their perform . bigg is more than enjoy , and chris klein ( who recent play a similar jock in elect ) is obvious a young talent on the rise . but in a teen-domin movi , the best perform come from comedian eugen levi ( of televis sctv ) , who is unexpect brilliant as jim uneasi father . scene in which the familiar father-son convers are brought to interest new level are the funniest moment to be found in american pie . after levi discov jim new use for appl pie , he tell him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . but i never use bake good . ' it is perform such as his , and bill murray in rushmor , that are often unfair dismiss when award are hand out . there are some less-than-origin aspect of the film . a bathroom incid involv finch and a bottl of ex-lax is someth we'v seen befor . if weitz is plan to take after the farrelli brother , then this is a decid unwis move : the same prank was pull in the brother dumb and dumber , and use to greater effect . second , the charact are forc into a half-heart climax that seem more artifici than amus . but at one point , in which we discov that american pie doe have a heart of it own , bigg ask his buddi whi he go through so much pressur for someth that `not veri import anyway . ' and so we realiz that while the film is express about a subject that is hard appropri , it still manag to be matur . in it own way .
1 well i'll be damn . . . the canadian can make a good movi . the world is come to an end . we don't know whi or how , but appar there is no way to stop it . the world has had this inform for month , as most of the riot and other assort chao has pass and govern have shut down oper . yet for a hand of toronto citizen , life goe on . they aren't go crazi or attack peopl in the street . instead they are simpli prepar themselv for the end . . . some engag in activ they'v alway want to do , some gather with famili and friend , and other just seek to be alon . these peopl live howev all intersect dure their final six hour . writer-director-star don mckellar has craft a high uniqu and emot film . all of the main charact are compel as they tri and do whatev it is they need to do on their last night on earth . craig ( callum keith renni ) tri to fulfil all his sexual fantasi , a gas compani employe ( david cronenberg ) call everi custom let them know the gas will be flow until the veri end and thank them for their busi , and patrick ( mckellar ) just want to be by himself but isn't have much success . even minor charact keep pop up where you least expect them to , tie everyon even closer . thing seem a littl hokey toward the begin of the film , but ultim everyth come togeth nice ( although it not a happi film . . . some moment are understand gut-wrench ) . the stori is enhanc by some unexpect humor and veri realist perform , particular from sandra oh , whose charact is just tri to get home to her husband befor the end . i have absolut no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given , nor doe it bother me that the world is end at exact 12 midnight ( in toronto anyway ) . but i do wonder whi the sun never set . come midnight , the sun is still shine bright . mayb the sun is crash into the earth . . . who know . also , it comfort to know that in mankind final moment on the planet , peopl will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpos of push over a car or a bus ( that not a shot at this film mind you . . . i know peopl are just stupid and truli would be out in the street tip over car ) . last night is avail on dvd from univers home video . it contain the film in fullscreen format and includ the origin theatric trailer .

0 i am a steven seagal fan . i onli say this now becaus " mufti splenetik " isn't my real name and becaus i probabl need to explain whi i went into this film expect great thing . ani proud seagal fan worth his bean will tell you that the seagal formula is someth you can depend on . seagal film can alway be count on for minim dialogu , heap of expend baddi with extem crunchabl bone ( which we'll alway hear when seagal doe his limb-twist thing ) , rare a femal co-lead in sight ( unless it a real-lif model-wif who hasn't work sinc weird scienc ) and , usual the worst possibl titl you can imagin . not to mention veri straightforward plot , general all-round bad dialogu and mr implac leather-fac himself in that same black outfit he been in sinc nico do his " my hand are sharp , nimbl knive " thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrifi ponytail , duke of dull . in the glimmer man , seagal break out of this formula : he get a * sidekick * , attempt to banter , and put on a new vest . he also put on quit a lot of weight . small potato , you may say , a man should be abl to accessor and banter if he want to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , whi fix it ? ( more on this disappoint person dash expect later ) . as jack cole , seagal is a homicid detect with a question past . while he and his partner ( play by keenen ivori wayan ) are investig a seri of ritual kill , cole himself becom a suspect , especi when a background check run by campbel reveal practic noth on cole . it turn out that cole is a former train govern assassin ( you just can't trust these homicid detect ) , someon whom victim use to catch just a glimps of in the jungl befor he pounc on them , and henc , well , you know , that " glimmer man " thing . an increas fishi homicid investig in the present soon lead to the gradual uncov of a larger , more threaten conspiraci that involv a crook businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deal involv chemic weapon . the glimmer man plot is pretti standard stuff , draw ( as with his other film ) element from the hotter film of the year ( eg , se7en ) . it the other chang that disappoint . for exampl , although there a fair amount of violenc in this movi , there also the disastr pair of seagal with keenen ivori wayan , probabl the best known of the wayan tribe ( how mani are there , exact ? ) from televis " in live colour . " wayan play whiney straightman to seagal bead-adorn and brocade-drap cole , keep up his " are you crazi " part of the dialogu with wast zest . as campbel , wayan confin himself to bemoan his new partner eccentr habit , but the chemistri between the two is minim , and seagal wooden comeback make for pain watch . a cook in under seig 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speak chines and wear prayer bead and intric silk jacket over his normal black ensembl . he chant , refus to fight unless truli provok and introduc campbel to powder deer peni to cure his allergi . again , a benign ( if trite ) plot devic except for the fact that these new charact trait requir seagal to speak more than usual . heck , he has to deliv punchlin and carri a steadi convers with someon other than himself for a larg part of the film . is that a lot to ask of the seagu ? too much . seagal best characterist use to be that he knew his purpos in this alreadi complic world of movi : to crunchili snap off bad guy appendag , and to do it silent , and alon . not for seagal , the snappi one-lin of arnold and stallon , nor the attempt to show that he can act , much less think . no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simpl , unadulter deathblow . that realli how it must have start : like-mind fan who knew what they want stream in to watch the seagu do his thing , know that never in the seagal univers would they ever have to see him do anyth els . we trust him . we got to know him . now , betray . i don't know if i can watch anoth seagal movi without that littl niggl doubt that he go to tri to be funni again . i'll tri , but it won't be easi . if you haven't watch the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . it easier to just fast forward the dialogu part and linger on the action sequenc . after all , if we can't depend on our fantasi , what can we depend on ? the fli inkpot rate system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a littl creaki , but still better than stay at home with gotcha ! * * * pretti good , bring a friend . * * * * amaz , potent stuff . * * * * * perfect . see it twice . mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan . everybodi make mistak onc in awhil .
1 i swear i have seen the edg befor . in fact , it remind me of the bear , the river wild , and other various film mix into an entir differ film . howev , the edg has done someth that most action film should do , and that is add heart and charact we like to the plot . in do so , the edg draw mani more suspens moment out of clich scene than , say , the peacemak . unfortun , becaus of those overus moment , we can pretti much guess the outcom of the film . but leav it to screenwrit david mamet to add humor and a few surpris to mess with your head . one surpris , in particular , left me smile just becaus mamet actual had the gut to add it to his script . action film are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat success at entertain us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respect genr : intellig . even horror film have learn this , a genr which is probabl the least respect of them all . the river wild was one of the best action/suspens film i have seen from the 90s . the intellig of the screenplay , and the suspens drawn from the realist charact is near unmatch to this day . the edg has the intellig and smart charact , but this time the lack of origin is the downfal . i must admit that it was veri suspens , and had an origin third half , but the first hour and a half is riddl with clich and plot hole . this is an exampl of the final act save the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . if onli the screenplay had maintain the final thirti minut intens , it could have becom a great action film ( and i use the term loos ) . the edg is pretti much a survival-of-the-fittest film . but take scream lead , the edg make fun of the genr clich , and then use them ( though not quit as effect ) . charl mors ( anthoni hopkin ) is the main charact , a rich and veri intellig man who wonder what the accumul of all this knowledg has brought to him . for onc , we don't immedi care for the main charact . instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photograph who is go to take pictur of charl wife , mickey ( ell macpherson ) , out in the wilder . they board a plane and head to a cabin somewher in the arctic . charl birthday is the same day , and he receiv a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . as action film go , these item do have import to the rest of the stori , but quit a bit more than we first expect . soon , howev , bob want to find a nativ to shoot pictur of becaus of his " person . " charl , bob , bob assist steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the preview , hit a flock of bird fli south for the winter . down the plane goe , the pilot is kill , and the three are left to surviv in the wilder . director lee tamahori is awar of the silli plot which is about to follow , and therefor has to creat origin way to approach the situat . he succeed often enough for us to enjoy the film . take , for instanc , the entir man-hunt bear plot . this has been done mani time in film with differ anim , and even bear . but given the charl intellig , and bob uncertainti , mani of the clich are given fresh twist . even charl himself seem to have seen these action film befor . my favorit line of the film come from charl : " most peopl die in the wilder becaus they didn't do the one thing that could save their life . . . think . " despit the predict of the main plot , a subplot develop late in the film which took me by surpris , and made me smile when i realiz that everyth isn't as it seem anymor . i have to write cautious as to not reveal this surpris , so instead i will avoid it entir . the first two-third of the edg have mani humor moment to push it along , and some of charl surviv techniqu seem possibl , even make fire from ice . tamahori is abl to creat a lot of suspens from the stalk bear , but whenev the bear is present , the charact lose all sensibl . i have alway wonder whi charact in film walk over a log to get across water . whi not do what an intellig person would and crawl across ? i guess get chase by a bear make your thought process turn off for a while . thank , we alreadi have begun to care for the charact , and so we let this small detail slide . but some of the technic detail are awkward , such as the nice stitch done on the fur coat that charl and bob make ( where did they get thread and needl ? ) . the act of the film is high abov averag for a film of this natur , and border on phenomen . anthoni hopkin give a terrif perform , creat his most likeabl and layer charact sinc remain of the day . hopkin usual bring great to his role , but here he exceed at gain the audienc sympathi , someth he definit did not do in silenc of the lamb . alec baldwin give one of his best perform i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . baldwin can be a good or a bad charact , and here he succeed at both in a way . you can never quit guess if he is a nice or a vllainous charact until the end , and baldwin is abl to handl the double-natur photograph . ell macpherson give a good perform , albeit slight . she isn't in the film all that much , but for the scene she doe have , she handl as an actress , not as a model . harold perrineau is a good actor , and his scene are nice and underplay . he is elimin earli , and i reveal noth by say this becaus it is inevit and predict . the edg is rate r for graphic violenc , some gore , and languag . some of the violenc is a littl too disturb , even for me . this film is a nice chang from the mindless action most of us are use to , but too mani clich bog it down . director tamahori has creat a veri smooth and suspens action film out of recycl part . david mamet script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the act is solid . the best thing about the script is the end which doesn't end with the normal high-strung action sequenc , but with a small detail involv a certain gift . it a nice touch consid what we have had to go through with the bear . and by the way , most peopl laugh when the film fade to black due to a larg credit to bart the bear . way to go , bart .
1 truman ( " true-man " ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey charact in this film . presid truman was an unassum man who becam known worldwid , in spite of ( or was it becaus of ) his statur .

" it best not to think about it , " she say , tri vain to chang truman memori . truman becom determin to see who or what is behind this appar elabor hoax at his expens . at everi turn he is stop by an amaz coincid that just happen to keep him in his own littl town . his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edg of the world . you know by now that truman life is the subject of a televis program . his action are " real " but everyth els is care script , from the death of his father to the choic of his wife . truman is determin to find out what the big hoax is . meanwhil , christof , the all-se creator of truman world doe his best to keep him unawar and happi . it sort of like westworld told from the robot point of view , or jurass park from the dinosaur point of view . we root for the captiv of the cage-world . our protagonist is count on " chao theori " to help him escap his elabor trap . the stori , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduc some interest question , such as the ethic of subject a person to this type of life , or the psycholog impact of learn that your entir life has all been fake . although these question came to mind , i don't think the film itself ask them . it certain didn't address them or tri to answer them . i was particular disappoint that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learn one life is a tv show . carrey perform at the end show a smidgen of truman pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easili for the sake of the film pace . earlier in the movi i found myself wonder if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . the two seem exclus of one anoth , but weir and niccol didn't see it that way . perhap it not fair to critic a movi for what it isn't , but it seem like there were some miss opportun here . but on it own term , the movi is well made . sight , sound and pace are all handl compet . much of the first part of the movi is the truman show . the scene are all appar shot from hidden camera , with snoot and obstruct cover the corner of the screen . one hidden camera is appar in his car radio , the green led number obscur the lower part of the screen . the music is well-chosen and score . the film open with what sound like famili drama theme music , when truman world is still beauti and perfect . when the movi end , the score sound more like a frantic , driven , tangerin dream opus , while still keep the same timbr . philip glass epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeat truman scene of suspicion and awaken . ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) and the pace of the stori was brisk . there was no unnecessarili long setup explain the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick titl card , a few interview , and then right into the show , and the movi . one of the first scene is of the studio light fall ; there was no token scene of truman idyl life befor it fall apart , becaus it wasn't necessari , we pick up the stori at the first sign of troubl , and no sooner . there also no point in the movi where the plot slow down . it a quick , straight shot to the movi end . in term of overal qualiti , i would compar the truman show to niccol gattaca . both film are well made with interest stori set in interest world . but neither film realli felt like it capit on all the great idea ; neither film " click " and becam an instant classic . nevertheless , i look forward to niccol next film , whatev it may be .
0 it a good thing most anim sci-fi movi come from japan , becaus " titan a . e . " is proof that hollywood doesn't have a clue how to do it . i don't know what this film is suppos to be about . from what i can tell it about a young man name kale who one of the last survivor of earth in the earli 31st centuri who unknow possess the key to save and re-gener what is left of the human race . that a fine premis for an action-pack sci-fi anim movi , but there no payoff . the stori take the main charact all over the galaxi in their search for a legendari ship that the evil " dredg " alien want to destroy for no appar reason . so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fight , fistfight , blaster fight and more double-cross than you can shake a stick at . there so much pointless sci-fi banter it too much to take . the galaxi here is a total rip-off of the " star war " univers the creator don't bother fill in the basic detail which make the stori confus , the charact unmotiv and superfici and the plot just plain bore . despit the fantast anim and special effect , it just not an interest movi .
1 origin titl don't lose your head , this parodi of the scarlet pimpernel stori was the first carri on to be produc by rank film product . two english fop , the powder , be-wig , be-ribbon sir rodney ffing ( sidney jame ) and his counterpart lord darci pew ( jim dale ) decid to travel to revolutionari franc in an attempt to rescu their fellow french royalist and aristocrat from lose their head by the guillotin . due to a seri of machin and disguis , they are larg success . ffing becom known as the black fingernail becaus he leav a call card behind which show two finger stick up , one with a black fingernail . after the fingernail rescu a promin royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charl hawtrey ) , citizen robespierr ( peter gilmor ) order the head of the secret polic citizen the big chees camembert ( kenneth william ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him . ( in fact , darci and ffing are their coachmen ! ) onc at calai , the fingernail meet jacquelin ( dani robin ) and they fall in love instant . he tell her his ident and give her his locket . when camembert realis that the fingernail is nearbi , he search the inn at calai and captur jacquelin , think that she is wear a diguis and is realli the fingernail ! jacquelin is imprison in the bastill and camembert , his love desire dubarri ( joan sim ) , and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail . they pretend to be of nobl stock , call themselv the duc and duchess de la plume de ma tant ( with bidet their assist ) and are invit by darci to a ball held by ffing . desire find out that ffing is the fingernail by wear the locket around her neck , but she end up fall in love with him . ffing attempt to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastill to rescu jacquelin , camembert has her move to the chateau neuv , and a climact sword-fight decid who will lose their head at the end of the film ! a more complex stori than most carri on , this film enjoy good product valu ( set , costum ) and an on-form cast . sid jame is excel as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth william excel as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expert play the substanti part of camembert thick-wit croni . other act honour go to joan sim who is perfect as desire and charl hawtrey who is excel as the french aristo pommfrit . although it suffer from a disaster over-long sword fight at the end of the film , it is larg success due to the perform of the main star , it slick and profession product , and it better-than-usu script . definit one of the best of the seri and a joy to watch .
0 i had an epiphani today . it occur to me while i was watch " hous on haunt hill .

0 i'm give this stinker . normal , the worst that i would ever rate a movi would be . but the total wast of time that is blaze saddl is , compound by the fact that this movi is incred offens , help me come to the big goos egg . i'm not sure what the hell mel brook was think when he made this thing , or if he was even think at all . mayb in mel littl mind a hors be knock unconsci becaus of a punch to the face is funni . in mine , it not . or mayb mel graduat from the spike lee school of filmmak . becaus onli the self-right lee use the n-word more often in his film than brook did in this one . at least lee has the smart to realiz that nobodi is go to find that term amus . brook bandi it about like he figur the audienc will be roll in the aisl everi time they hear it . wrong mel ! i would call you a boob mel , but that insult breast everywher . this idiot attempt at a comedi center on the evil lieuten governor ( harvey korman ) attempt to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad . he send his goon to run the townsfolk out . but the town appeal to the governor ( mel brook in one of mani uninspir , and unfunni role ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them . the governor pawn the task off to korman charact hedley lamarr .

0 tommi lee jone chase an innoc victim around america who is tri to prove that she did not kill her spous . the fugit ? not quit ? this is the plot for doubl jeopardi , anoth fugit copycat without the action , excit , and good act that the origin had . there are other slight differ besid one movi be bad and the other good ; this time tommi lee jone play a parol offic not a us marshal , clever huh ? oh and the fugit ashley judd was frame by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who need to collect two million dollar in life insur money not a one arm man . both movi are on video . make the wise choic and pick the fugit . there are so mani flaw in doubl jeopardi , it is laughabl . while serv time in prison , libbi parson ( judd ) discov that she can never be charg for commit the same crime twice . learn that her husband is still aliv , she decid to serv her time in prison , find him , retriev her son , and kill her husband if necessari . when the strict parol offic travi lehman ( jone ) stand in her way , libbi decid to break the rule ( who know whi ? ) and continu her plan , despit the fact that if she get caught , she go back to jail . director bruce beresford spend way too much time tri to convinc the audienc that libbi miss her son . everi other scene , we are given a shot of libbi stare and cri at his pictur . in an action movi like this , valuabl time wast on these shot take away more opportun for libbi to get up and do someth . all that is need in this type of movi is a short scene in which libbi tell herself or a friend " i miss my son . " noth more , noth less . dr . kimbl of the fugit didn't look at one pictur of his dead wife , his primari concern was to save himself . libbi at time show this same determin but not near enough . ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excel actor but if they continu to do movi like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their career , kind of like their doom co-star tommi lee jone . win an oscar for the fugit must have convinc jone that audienc will never get tire of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilti role . peopl still pay to see his movi and he make plenti of money so i guess he was right . though i don't think he will win anoth oscar again . the ultim mistak in the script is what eventu becom of libbi parson . even if she was excus for disobey her parol offic , the number of other crime she commit while on the run are too numer to count . burglari , assault , grand theft auto are some of libbi slipup . the messag of the movi is you can break all of the small law as long as you'r innoc of the major crime . hope crimin won't use doubl jeopardi as a refer in court for whi they are innoc . that would just be plain stupid .
1 when jim henson pass away , he left behind divers legion of fan and a compani whose ultim success , it now seem , hing on his input . jim henson product and the creatur shop are still thrive financi , but as the last two muppet film ( or that silli computer-gener monkey from lost in space ) demonstr , the thrill and genius are gone . i'm not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generat from an audienc of kid five to fifti the same awe-fil respons . an all-pow crystal has crack , caus the leader of the green world to split apart into two be : the big , gentl mystic , and the vulture-lik skeksi . the mystic send jen , a naiv gelfl boy , on a mission to find the shard that crack away , which must be reinsert into the crystal befor the skeksi becom etern ruler , befor the great " conjunct " of three sun . along the way , jen encount and team up with the onli other gelfl aliv , the rebecca demornay-lik kira , an ogre-witch name aughra , who remov her eye to look at thing , and a spastic-but-friend , tumbleweed-lik anim name fizzgig . much of the beauti in the dark crystal , which is a simpl tale ( though it doe not condescend to ani viewer ) , lie in it art direct and creatur design . the puppet is phenomenal--observ the scene in which jen play his flute , or the landwalk chase--but i must stress that ani thought of string and hand and remot control all but vanish in the open moment of the pictur , a delicately-narr ( by john baddeley ) , absorb prologu . the voic work in the film , by muppet regular and irregular , is tone-perfect . as well , trevor jone score should not be discount : it contribut to the film almost as an unseen charact . i suppos , due to the complex involv in execut a movi of this natur , that it couldn't be help , but i wish the film was longer . jen and kira have wonder . . . well , chemistri , and more scene of them quiet convers would have been appreci . the dark crystal has a veri small cult follow . the weaker labyrinth is probabl better-known , which is upset . a friend of mine relat a stori to me that henson was pressur into plant human among labyrinth creatur due to the financi failur of people-less the dark crystal . that film never quit found it foot ; it play like an acid-trip episod of " the muppet show " with david bowi as guest-host , borrow from tolkien and pander to tolkien fan-bas . ( i suppos i just made labyrinth sound appet to a certain sector of the public . ) the dark crystal deserv ( and still deserv ) a bigger audienc . it the best kind of children entertain : eleg , fantast , and courag un-hip . brian henson , fortun son , keep look back at this , your father masterpiec .
1 not sinc attend an ingmar bergman retrospect a few year ago have i seen a film as uncompromis in it portray of emot truth as secret & lie . like bergman , director mike leigh is interest in probe his charact inner depth through hypernatur blunt confront . also like bergman , leigh engag in frequent closeup of his charact ravish and wrack face . and the promin mourn of a cello on the soundtrack recal bergman own use of a bach cello suit in an earlier film . all that is miss is a discuss of god . which is not to say that secret & lie is noth more than an homag to the swedish master . in fact , it is quit possibl leigh had no such intent in mind . nonetheless , what we get is so far remov from the averag moviego experi -- even from the reason we go to the movi in the first place -- that it take some effort to adjust to the film rhythm . onc the adjust is made , howev , there are great reward . one such is the chanc to see life on the screen as it realli is . though leigh may have adopt some of bergman stylist touch , most obvious in an earli scene of ters cross-cut dure a marri coupl strain convers , as well as in that somewhat obtrus score , the overal feel of the film is that it eschew ani " style " at all . wherea bergman use artific as a tool to expos realiti , leigh make the camera a mere observ , almost as in a pbs documentari . the effect of this is to focus all of your attent on the actor . it is a tribut to everyon involv that , despit such scrutini , onli infrequ are we awar that anyon * is * act . much has been made of brenda blethyn perform , and right so , but it is onli when you remind yourself that you are watch a fiction that you realiz how good she is . there are a few misstep . for one , except for one scene ( tragicom , as it happen ) , there is scant humor in the film . this lead to a certain monoton tone throughout . and occasion ( as with bergman ) the blunt of the situat can seem forc . for all that , this longish film manag to keep hold of your attent . it is unfortun that the audienc for secret & lie will most like be limit to an intellectu elit , for there is noth inher intellectu about this film . in fact , it might easili reson more strong for million of work class filmgoer who will like never see it . there is even a sweet but signific ironi in the film unspoken take on race relat , someth an american audienc at least would do well to observ . nonetheless , secret & lie is not for the faint of heart . though there is noth physic horrif to make one squeamish , the explor of common human frailti can be so raw and unspar that it is tempt to turn from the screen . needless to say , it is also veri depress at time . but for mani of us , of cours , so is life . and though the film is too honest to tack on a phoni happi end , that same honesti allow it to admit that thing can also get better .
0 dr . alan grant ( sam neill , " jurass park " ) is becom disillus . paleontolog is no longer the sexi scienc it onc was sinc the ingen corpor clone his subject matter . his lectur bring peopl interest in his adventur on isla nubla rather than his research and fund dollar are dri up . when the kirbi ( william h . maci , " fargo " ; tea leoni , " the famili man " ) ask him to be their guid for an anniversari flyover of isla sorna ( the notori site b of " the lost world " ) he disdain , but onc they wave their checkbook , he reconsid . howev the kirbi haven't given dr . grant their real agenda in " jurass park iii . " of cours , we , the audienc , have been tip off , given that the film begin by show us eric ( trevor morgan , " the patriot " ) , a young boy , and ben ( mark harelik , " elect " ) go for a paraglid adventur off that same island that goe awri ( and look like cheesi rear project ) . grant establish back home with a new right hand man , billi brennan ( alessandro nivola , " love labour lost " ) on site at a dig in montana sore lack fund . he also pay a visit to old flame dr . elli sattler ( laura dern , " jurass park " ) , now marri to anoth with a young son who call grant the dinosaur man appar for the sole purpos of dredg her up again for the film poor imagin final . grant take billi along on the kirbi trip , which is realli an illeg gambit to save their son , that young paraglid . the coupl aren't millionair , make grant check bogus , and they'r separ as well ( eric was with amanda new boyfriend , not that that make much sens ) , mean we'r in for some gooey famili dynam while wait for the dino dine . the kirbi hire hand ( and obvious bait ) are a threesom led by mr . udeski ( michael jeter , " the gift " ) . ( didn't anyon consid that cast michael jeter and william h . maci togeth and not have them be relat was a littl odd ? ) as direct by joe johnston ( " octob sky , " " jumanji " ) ( spielberg onli produc this one ) from a risibl script by peter buchman and the " elect " team of alexand payn & jim taylor , " jurass park iii " is noth more than a quicki monster flick with a coupl of new dino ( a spinosauraus , which goe head to head with the t-rex , and pteranodon ) . the plot , as it were , is a seri of coincid combin with extrem leap of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone trick . the effect are no longer new , and , as shot by televis cinematograph shelli johnson , rather murki look at time . film edit by robert dalva ( " octob sky " ) was presum done by machet , to keep this down to a 90 minut run time . i know of no other reason to explain the ridicul end which featur the survivor confront a pack of raptor , then be save by the most ludicr of logic jump within a few minut . origin music by don davi just repeat john william origin theme . while neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and human into the proceed , the rest of the cast are plod unexcept .

1 i don't box with kid glove . i don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easi on a film . i consid it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethic for a movi critic . howev , i do some favor , and these often come in the form of point that i hand to certain group due to the artist braveri . rigormorti , the product compani that has been my prime exampl of how money doe not need to motiv filmmak , get sever of these point each time . i still , howev , will not go easi on them . they recent sent me a vhs copi of their down with america trilog ( which begin , quit wittili , with a disclaim that they are not tri to undermin america with the make of this film . ) and i decid to spend an hour of my day watch it . in the famous line of mani martyr , i have no regret . well , i do have some regret , but that is not the point in the previous sentenc . the point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critic standpoint , did not entir disappoint me . sure , the riski use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natur light was one of the most annoy thing about public access film , but the movi itself was fair enjoy . down with america concern a govern agent , needless murder , and a book contain everyth from the unabomb manifesto to the 1995 appl comput profit report . like the previous film of rigormorti that i have review , it display an off-kilt humor and intellig ? it succeed in make me laugh where countless studio film fail . the best way to see this film would be as a parodi of the countless conspiraci film that we have been drown in sinc the paranoia of the 80s . a die movement from the day they start , these paranoid `thriller had the govern alway cover up someth and had the same favorit word : `roswel . ' in down with america , the line `roswel is high absent . with an about ten minut run time , down with america effortless sidestep everi clich ? that the conspiraci film fell into , make joke at them at the same time , and provid us with funni and memor charact . again , i have seen movi that have gone on two hour with charact i couldn't care less about . the film , as previous state , concern a feder agent ( peter roach ) , an obsess librarian ( meri steven ) , a mysteri man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two peopl obsess with silenc in the librari ( robb sherman , kevin flower ) . the plot : a book contain the secret of all anarchist is hidden in ? a public librari where it can be view by all . from there we go into a delight parodi . the feder agent claim his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goe on a diatrib about the sanctiti of book . we spend our time laugh at fair idiot joke that are perform much too well consid the lack of coach of the cast . although the actor and actress are in small role and give a whole new mean to `no-nam , it end up be the no-nam peopl who do a good job , deliv better perform as comic villain than half the crap that hollywood turn out . for onc , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locat the film onlin . i can onli say that you should find my previous review of l'auto and les x-file and look up the rigormorti product site in and of itself . it almost as much fun as the film .
1 synopsi : in phantom menac the galaxi is divid into power group whose interest will inevit collid in later sequel . there is an overarch galact unit nations-typ organ call the senat presid by a weak chancellor . within the senat two camp are at odd : a bicker , isolationist allianc call the republ and their aggress rival the trade feder . preserv law and order are a council of jedi knight who are meanwhil search for a prophesi chosen one of virgin birth . manipul event behind the scene is a danger , reemerg clan call the dark lord of sith , so shadowi and secret that they compris a " phantom " menac . jedi knight qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentic obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) wit an invas of teenag queen amidala home planet naboo and befriend a gungan name jar jar ( ahm best ) . on the desert planet of tatooin the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natali portman ) attend a lengthi drag race involv the young boy anakin skywalk ( jake lloyd ) . the five protagonist tri to solicit help for free naboo by visit the citi planet of corusc where a lot of debat and polit maneuv take place . can they free amidala helpless planet ? opinion : on tv last night i watch young , wannab celeb pay $400 a ticket and come run out of theater to bask in front of news camera , gush with testimoni of the phantom menac great in exchang for a few second of be on nation televis . given this kind of media mania i wonder if phantom menac , the most anticip movi of 1999 , could possibl live up to the extraordinari hype that preced it . doe phantom menac match the exagger hype ? director georg luca answer , " it onli a movi . " to me , ani movi with russian-sound accent for bad guy , jamaican accent for good guy , and middl eastern-sound accent for seedi gambler accent can be expect to be more tongu in cheek than profound . visual , star war : episod i --the phantom menac ( 1999 ) is a kid show where parent can take their young one to marvel at child-friend cgi charact and wondrous backdrop even if the charact dialogu ( most geopolit ) is beyond the level of children . it is left to parent to patient explain the convers : droid origin , famili lineag , the definit of term like blockad , appeas , feder , allianc , symbiosi , satellite-control robot et cetera . at least this much is clear : there plenti of eye candi , and in the last few minut it good guy and joe camel lookalik versus a cape , horn red devil charact and his mechan hord . weak : weak lie in the write and in the perform . at first it seem like the film is to be an invas stori , but then phantom take an hour-long detour to cover one chariot race befor return to the invas theme . this dilut the central stori . addit , smaller scene seem written self conscious , as if they were ad more to fill us in on extran background inform for other movi rather than form an integr part of the present movi . veteran actor liam neeson and ewan mcgregor notic outperform the other act lead . better ensembl chemistri between the five lead and background inform that is central to a tight stori line could have made have given phantom stronger perform and storytel punch . strength : on the bright side phantom menac as a big-budget product is far ahead of the competit in term of make whimsic creatur , world and vehicl appear real . the film boast sophist , top-of-the-lin visual and qualiti exot costum , a music score entertain enough to stand alon , and three worthwhil sequenc in the second half . bottom line ? see the film is entertain and inform , like a visual theme park with star war filler inform serv as dialogu between impress money shot . we are bound to be complet inund by star war public , music and tie-in for the next few month .

1 satir film usual fall into one of two categori : 1 ) long-term satir where everyth , includ the joke , is somehow relat on a larg scale ( i . e . " dr . strangelov " ; 2 ) situat satir in which the comedi and theme are deriv moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . " men in black " ) . what uniqu about " wag the dog " is that it doesn't necessarili fit either of these descript , and yet is both at the same time . the result is a clever comedi base on an origin , smart premis , even if the focus doe tend to wander a bit . if there anyth that affect american the most it polit and showbusi . in this age of inform and technolog , we'v been so condit by the media and the entertain industri in our way of perceiv thing , it gotten to the point that we are practic control by it . we need the media to bring us the most up-to-d news , but we also need the escap of hollywood to counter all that think . this film start off well by quick establish these idea , and then present an interest scenario : if polit , the media coverag of polit , and the entertain industri are so close relat , couldn't someon with the power and author to manipul one of the aspect manipul them all ? that the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a profession washington spin doctor , come up with in order to restor the presid good name who has been accus of child molest just week befor the elect . brean , along with the presid top advisor , winifr ame ( hech ) , fli to california to meet up with hot-shot movi produc stanley motss ( hoffman ) . they pitch him an idea to " produc " the imag of a war with albania ( it a countri no one heard of so they peopl will buy it ) . soon the wheel are in motion and the film rif satir come into play . we'r inund with the hollywood mind set as motss bring in a number of expert to help manag the situat , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effect technician , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leari ) . the initi atmospher is rich with numer pop cultur refer where everyth somehow relat to someth on tv , in the movi , or in the news . the charact dialogu is witti and funni , although some of the actual joke and gag seem rather sitcom-esqu . for exampl , one scene show motss and brean product crew film an actress portray a poor albanian refuge . motss order a kitten for the girl to carri , but instead wound up with a dozen differ dog . sinc it all computer-enhanc anyway , she end up cradl a bag of tostito with the kitten to be insert later . this demonstr the film abil to take a relat ordinari situat and make it smart and funni just through the premis . but then there the gag and one-lin that , although are humor , seem a littl gratuiti in the long run such as motss not be abl to rememb the actress name , or , whenev a problem emerg , alway respond with , " this is noth ! " by the time the film make it to the midpoint , everyth that is go to happen in term of plot happen . the first act is quick pace , while the second act contain most of the joke and is the core of the film . everi ten minut or so a new problem crop up that motss and brean must deal with , and it alway fascin to see what they do and how they do it . the screenplay provid good character and actual deal with most of the problem head-on in realist manner . howev , it doe have a tendenc to avoid thing and shift it focus from the elect campaign and fals war smokescreen to someth a bit off the subject . as the third act roll around the satir natur becom more concern with the situat and less so with the big pictur . what had start off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiraci to fool the general public begin to seem more like someth that would happen in a movi . still , the situat comedi is quit funni , especi a montag show the entir countri fling old shoe into tree to honor sgt . willi schumann - a war hero motss and brean concoct . truli great satir manag to creat for an entertain stori that make you laugh at the time , but think about afterward and " wag the dog " at least succeed in this respect . howev , in retrospect it seem like so much more could have been done , name by extend the run time and fill in the plot hole . then again , it a valiant effort .

0 bicentenni man is a famili film without ani extern motiv with the except of provid the minimum dose of entertain . chris columbus , the director who gave you " mrs . doubtfir " , play on sentiment string and mushi dialogu to make his point . base on the short stori by isaac asimov , it is suppos to be a scienc fiction stori about a robot who want to be human , which as you can imagin is veri difficult . start in a not too distant futur the film concentr on a wealthi famili that buy an android to help them with the hous and children . soon this robot , call andrew ( robin william ) show abil that make his owner mr . martin ( sam neill ) veri curious . andrew is interest in art and music , he " enjoy " make clock , which clear show that he has genuin emot . it show out that becaus of a small failur in the " electr circuit " and " positron brain " andrew has accident gain a soul . this make him uniqu and his evil creator worri . then mr . martin decid to teach andrew all the thing he wasn't program to do . soon andrew want to leav the hous in pursuit of freedom , destini and love . this film can be describ as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shine as the biggest gem in the crown of scienc fiction . ever sinc that film , the subject of human still stand as one big controversi . what make us human ? the thought ? the emot ? is it possibl to becom human ? at what point can we say to a robot " now you are one of us " ? these are veri tough question that requir a serious and thurral approach . it is obvious that columbus didn't take them veri serious . when you think about it , this film is not realli medit on the question " when is a robot no longer a machin , but a human be ? " , but tell a stori about racial discrimin and lack of understand . andrew is so complex and emot from the veri begin that the audienc immedi accept him as a human be , and onli the societi has troubl with it . in other word , it is as far from realiti as from the academi award . further more , there are other annoy problem . to this day no serious filmmak has dare to specul about the futur in more than 50 year from now . this has not been done for obvious reason , becaus the filmmak are well awar of the fact that they lack the knowledg and imagin to perform such a difficult task . columbus is the first to have cross that line . the result is , as you might imagin , primit , unrealist and incred disappoint effort . the world is simpli frozen in time . neither the societi , fashion , cultur or valu have chang over 200 year . mom is still work at the kitchen , do the dish . when you think back to the late 17th centuri and then compar it to the world we live in today , you'll see a slight bigger differ . i am not say that everyth should chang . it is unlik that the human right will chang , but it even more unlik that there will not be ani progress in scienc , technolog and fashion . i suppos it possibl to watch this as a some sort of bizarr fairytal , but it realli hard . robin william is hidden behind c and speak in a robot way . as alway he doe a decent job , as doe sam neill . but it doesn't realli matter . it is the sentiment and length that turn this pictur into a tiresom experi . pretti much like last year " meet joe black " , this is a primit and unresolv stori which is present with a splendor and profession that it doesn't deserv . great actor and a talent crew have work hard to achiev someth that will be instant forgotten . when isaac asimov wrote this stori , the futur seem far away and magic . everyth seem possibl . now is the futur of asimov time , and we know that it is not as magic and perfect as it seem a long time ago . for the same reason that the young generat of today can not be amaz by julius vern " 20 000 leagu under the sea " , so can't we accept this stori as a potenti realiti . let us hope that next year " a . i . " will be more reward .

" gordo get the job to remov asbesto and other hazard materi from the spooki old mental hospit in prepar for reloc town offic there . their guid tour of the facil by a local offici , bill gigg ( paul guilfoyl ) , bring them through some of the creepier part of the former asylum . but , a job is a job and , if they finish in a week , as promis , there is a $10000 bonus in store . as they get down to their work , thing , normal and not so normal , begin to happen . gordon hear a disembodi voic beckon him . phil ( david caruso ) is conflict work with a guy , hank ( josh luca ) , who is see his old girlfriend . mike ( co-screenwrit steven gevedon ) has discov a cach of audiotap and transcript from old psychiatr session ( henc , the titl ) with inmat mari hobb , a multi-person patient with a dark secret . gordo nephew , jeff ( brendan sexton iii ) , suffer from night phobia and is afraid to ventur into the dark bowel of the hospit . as the agre upon week draw to an end , hank mysteri disappear from the workplac after a nocturn confront with someon ( someth ? ) in the hospit . tension mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chanc for the bonus start to slip away . but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospit and it histori of insan weigh on them all . i don't want to give away too much of the stori of " session 9 , " so i'll stop there . what we have here is a spooki horror flick that use none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shot that have becom part and parcel with horror film sinc the advent of " halloween " and " friday the thirteenth . " there is no cat leap out of the dark or the shock of sudden see oneself in a strateg place mirror . with the except of one shadowi and chill imag at one point spooki interlud in the film , there is littl that you can get your arm around as far as what , specif , is " frighten . " as i watch " session 9 " i becam awar of the subtl thing that built up dure the stori that make it a true horror movi . the strike high-definit video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who work with the director , brad anderson , on his " next stop wonderland " ) help to build up tension with close-up , fluid camera movement and odd angl in a way that would make alfr hitchcock proud . music , too , is use to intens effect , join with the camera to make simpl scene frighten , even horrifi . coupl these tech feat with an intellig stori that use element of " the shine , " " the blair witch project " and , even " the texa chainsaw massacr " and you get a decent , intrigu horror flick . addit , the brilliant decis to shoot at danver state hospit give the film anoth star charact , the institut itself , which lend even more chill to the equat . act is anoth factor that rais " session 9 " abov the usual dreck present in recent horror hit like " scream , " " i know what you did last summer " and their sequel . those film took good-look , though generic , young actor and actress and put them to use to build up a bodi count , substitut mayhem for real horror . anderson opt , instead , to use matur , experienc actor like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his charact shoe and the differ in cast qualiti is notabl . mullan , in particular , put an arc on his charact , gordon , as the troubl guy who slowli and inexor fall under the pressur of famili , job and , final , danver state hospit . the rest of the small cast fit the bill as peopl , not just fodder for the mayhem . david caruso , as gordo senior man and near equal in the busi , show just how good an actor he is . he made the jump from tv " nypd blue " to film far too soon and his decis in the role he took ( i'll never forget the horrend " jade " ) were less than star make . he roll his sleev up and doe the job well here . gevedon , luca and sexton are more than fodder , too . the onli problem with " session 9 " lay in the uninspir end . it take on a fair convent final that cover old ground and is a bit of a disappoint after the terrif ( and inspir ) build up . the pleasur is get there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so abli built dure the bulk of the film " session 9 " is an unusu feat . it is scari , doesn't use cheap trick and rais goos bump with it intellig render , subtl horror . becaus of the local interest of danver , it should do well with the northeast crowd . i hope it get the nation distribut it deserv . i give it a b+ .

0 " meg ryan is irresist in the comedi that celebr sisterhood ! , " scream the televis ad for " hang up , " disastr written by real-lif sister delia and nora ephron and sloppili direct by dian keaton . make me laugh again ! not onli is " hang up " misadvertis , sinc the film wholeheart focus on middl sister meg ryan and give her two co-star , lisa kudrow and dian keaton , littl more than extend cameo , but they don't actual come togeth until the final ten to fifteen minut . and we are suppos to believ their strong bond , and smile in the last scene when they rekindl their rocki relationship , despit them be apart for the major of the run time ? excus me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truli delusion notion . eve mark ( meg ryan ) is the middl mozzel sister , still live in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre-teen son ( jess jame ) . her elder , wisecrack father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest perform in year ) has just recent been put into the hospit , in the final stage of what i assum is alzheim ( even though the film never enlighten us on exact what is wrong with him ) . while eve relationship with her mother ( clori leachman ) is near nonexist , sinc she ran out on lou and her children year ago , she has had her fair share of up and down with lou , who use to be an alcohol . her older sister is georgia ( dian keaton ) , an editor for the self-titl magazin , " georgia , " while maddi ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress . interest , their profess are given , but we not onc ever see them work at their job , or , for that matter , learn much of anyth about them . maddi , georgia , and eve do not see each other much anymor , their adult live gradual caus them to drift apart , but they do manag to consist talk on the phone to one anoth . and they talk . and talk . and talk . . . in fact , the telephon is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appear in virtual everi scene of this intermin 92-minut catastroph that feel like it three hour long . if you are abl to get through the open half-hour , in which phone ring so much you feel like jump through the screen and take a sledgehamm to them , you will sure surviv the rest . the question is , who would want to subject themselv to this resolut irrit , self-involv pat-on-the-back ? how could a comedy-drama that has the star-pow of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and dian keaton be so veri bad in so mani differ way ? issu from the past involv the possibl jealousi each has had for one of the other is fleet brought up , but the film isn't matur enough to deal with such a thing in a thought manner , and sinc we learn next to noth about their childhood , it is a lost caus that come off as noth more than an afterthought . also , it is expect that the viewer quick catch on to the tricki dynam that the three sister have with one anoth , but no dynam metamorphos . and when they do reunit in the final , their whole consanguin is reduc to a repuls annoy three-minut scene in which they argu like littl children . you can see the impend death come a mile away , and it conveni occur in the next scene , so that the three can quick come to term with themselv , and with each other . you think to yourself : " the onli thing left for them to do is have a play food-fight , " and like clockwork , it also occur by the end credit . meg ryan is a versatil actress ( look no further than 1998 " hurlybur " or 1994 " when a man love a woman " ) , despit her various detractor who stubborn believ all she can do is romant comedi . with " hang up , " the onli thing she need to do is complet sever her filmmak tie with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn't be allow to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profil debacl . even if she knew what she was make was not exact up to par in the qualiti depart , she nonetheless is veri good , and the two scene that work , flashback to christma 1988 , when she had a heartbreak run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crash her son birthday parti in a drunken stupor , are effect becaus of the realism ryan bring to the situat . dian keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wild feebl compliment . what is more than a littl far-fetch is that keaton is distinct older than ryan and kudrow , although in the veri brief glimps we get at them as children , she is no more than five year ryan senior . yeah , right . last , poor lisa kudrow has been wast onc again in a big-screen ventur , after her even more thin role in 1999 " analyz this . " kudrow isn't given enough time to creat a full person with maddi , so it isn't her fault she doesn't regist until a few quiet moment sprinkl throughout where she is actual bless with be given dialogu . if anyth , though , kudrow is a real talent , and i anxious await the next time she is given a role more deserv of her time , as in her brilliant nuanc , oscar-calib work in 1998 " the opposit of sex . " if you are a fan of kudrow ( and who isn't ? ) , do yourself a favor and rent this gem that put more good use to kudrow in sixti second than " hang up " doe in it entireti . as eve hardwork husband , adam arkin is , predict , squander with a role that give him next to noth to do , until a subplot reveal itself midway through , onli to never be mention again . clori leachman , as with ryan and matthau , make a small , but notic impress with her , albeit , veri brief appear , while edi mcclurg , as a rosy-cheek woman lou had an affair with in the christma 1988 flashback , manag one of the few laugh in this otherwis joyless product . near all the emot display within " hang up " are patent manufactur , and despit the movi want the viewer to care about the charact , asid from eve , whi would you want to when they are all spoil brat ? if , for some bizarr , " twilight zone " -type of reason , you find yourself in a movi theater show this film , my suggest would be to hang up on it befor the open credit are over . say it is a wast of time is an understat of epic proport .

1 let say you live at the end of an airport runway . larg jetlin continu pass over your hous , rattl your window and allow few moment of peac . let say the ground beneath your feet is also contamin with toxic substanc , and high voltag power line run across steel tower onli yard from your home . now let say an airport conglomer want to buy your properti in order to lengthen the runway , and offer you more than it worth . wouldn't you jump in the air and have your bag pack befor you land ? of cours you would . but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradis , and the hous your castl ? that what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he happi that a multi-n corpor would like to buy his home , sorri , it not for sale . unfortun , the corpor wield quit a bit of influenc over the australian govern , which serv darryl and his famili with what amount to an evict notic . not about to take this lie down , darryl enlist the help of his inept attorney friend denni denuto ( tiriel mora ) and make a determin , albeit pathet , attempt to fight back . the castl , an australian comedi by rob sitch , is perhap one of the simplest movi i'v seen in recent memori , yet also one of the funniest . in fact , it is this film relianc on simplic which make it so success . the good guy and the bad guy are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storylin is as uncompl as it get . it the perfect setup for a relax , hilari good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i like the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watch this film . i just sat back and enjoy myself . the situat is one we'v seen befor : regular joe fight back against the govern , or big busi , or whatev . what make this film differ is it charact . darryl think he got the best life in the world - he tell his famili that live next to power line is a constant remind of the success of mankind , he ask who would ever want to go out and eat in a fanci restaur when he got the meat loaf feast prepar by his wife sal ( ann tenni ) , and he swell with pride when his son dale ( stephen curri ) dig a hole in the yard . steve kerrigan ( anthoni simco ) constant comb the buy and sell ad look for " invest " like joust stick and overhead projector , while wayn kerrigan is in jail , as a result of denni denuto incompet courtroom maneuv . the great thing about the kerrigan is that they aren't so stupid that they get annoy . they'r just a group of simpleton whose naiv natur is perfect harmless and even endear . we look upon them with a littl bit of piti , but a whole lot of affect . screenwrit sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedi pit this lovabl bunch of unlik crusad against a stoic court system and a condescend busi conglomer , further polar the extrem and deepen our feel for the kerrigan . sympathi for their situat , the laughter they bring us , and the famili wonder character , simpl as it may be , leav us with a degre of emot invest that caus us to actual care about what happen to them . i suppos one might wonder how deep character can go when your charact are as inan as the kerrigan , but trust me , it work . i particular note that the writer did not have to use slapstick in order to get laugh . don't get me wrong - slapstick , when execut well , can be genius . it just that too often , a film will resort to it use as a shortcut to amus the audienc , not alway success . instead , the joke in the castl are all hing upon the dialog utter by these peopl who have no idea that they are total skew to the rest of the world . when they are by themselv , the are funni , and when they are with normal peopl , they are hilari . one of the few problem i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . the kerrigan go out to a vacat spot for seem no reason other than to pack in a few more joke and increas the film run time . luckili , it a funni littl detour that , while slight distract from the film main drive , is still quit enjoy . with all the leviti abound in the castl , the film still manag to take on a pretti heavi concept , that of the innat right of a citizen to keep his properti , an issu which has been bandi about in court across the civil world with differ outcom . i'm not certain the courtroom monologu near the end of the film would actual hold up in real life , but it bring to the forefront the essenc of the constitut ( of australia ) and certain sound impress at ani rate . and , for that matter , it more than i would have expect out of a light heart film like this .

0 boy , what a great movi ! ! keanu reev and morgan freeman act togeth , the director of the fugit ( andrew davi ) back again to give us anoth thriller , and the beauti rachel steal beauti weisz thrown in to boot . how could this not be a blockbust ? all die-hard keanu reev fan , read on . ol " much ado about noth " play eddi kasalivich , a machinist studi at the univers of chicago . to help pay for the rent , he take on this job make the machineri for a hydrogen project be conduct by the univers . by happi coincid , he also happen to stumbl on the solut to the final problem and thus is the onli one who know the key to perform this feat of miracl physic . this project hold great promis : take hydrogen from water and give out more energi than is put in . a potenti solut to the earth energi problem without the pollut cost . sure nobodi could have ani problem with that ? morgan freeman is paul shannon , the project sponsor . he work for a veri power organ that disagre with the patern project leader as to how quick technolog should be releas to the public . he figur the world will disintegr into anarchi if the result of the project are releas too quick . so he murder the project leader , blow up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city-devast thing ) and tri to simul the experi at some other hi-tech hush-hush locat . unfortun , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manag to get away and now follow a fugitive-lik chase use a not too dissimilar rehash of that movi script . this movi is just die for a comparison with " the fugit " . both movi use chicago as the main citi and sinc the place doesn't chang much , i guess we can't realli blame the set for the pauciti of atmospher . the troubl here is that where the fugit had harrison ford and tommi lee jone , chain reaction onli has keanu reev and fred ward . credit to them , but we aren't realli given much of a chanc to empathis with the charact . where ford was abl to work within the confin of the movi to evok sympathi , eddi kasalivich just doesn9t seem veri believ and reev charact is never given the time to develop . it might have been a better invest in film to give the charact more depth and spend less time on the chase sequenc , which frank , get quit bore after a while . harrison ford was " the man against the world .

0 pleas don't mind this windbag let off a bit of steam . . . i just want to warn all of y'all not to wast your hard-earn $$$ on anaconda . it not even worth a 99-cent video rental . don't listen to ebert on this one ( he has no clue what he talk about ! ) btw i accompani my friend to this one becaus she was * requir * to watch it on assign ( she review movi for a local paper ) . now i'll actual back up my huf and puf . here goe : movi : anaconda rydain bottom line : wait for it to come on usa up all night . even then , i doubt it worth the price of jolt ( to help you stay up that late ! ) whi do i hate anaconda ? let me count the way . . . first of all , this movi get way too mani snake fact wrong . as an ophiophil ( snake lover ) , i can tell you that a ) anaconda would never reach a length of 40 feet , b ) they'r scare of peopl , c ) case of snake eat adult human are extrem rare becaus human shoulder are too wide to fit in a snake mouth , and constrictor snake don't kill what they can't eat , d ) peopl can outrun snake with no troubl , especi heavi one like anaconda , e ) if an anaconda did eat a human , it would need at least 6 month of sit on it butt to digest the huge meal , therefor it couldn't run around gobbl up everybodi els in the cast , and f ) snake have no vocal cord , so they can't make funni squeal nois . whew . i was prepar to suspend realiti if the movi would have been worth it . unfortun , anaconda was about as suspens and excit as watch paint peel . my friend and i even success predict who would live at the end . anybodi can tell the bad guy is go to die eventu . that was a piti becaus his charact was one of the few reason my friend and i didn't give up and fall asleep . he was the most likabl charact in the movi . who wouldn't enjoy somebodi who look like a derang walt whitman ? anaconda did have it cute moment : argument between ice cube charact and the british guy , for instanc . howev , those small flash of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty-eight minut of bore schlock . the writer had - and blew - a multitud of opportun to insert funni line . i was quit disappoint with a scene where a young guy tell a young ladi that the jungl make him horni . did she retort with a clever , ego-with comeback ? of cours not ! " i'm tri to work ! " gee , that even dumber than the crap comeback i come up with . she could have told him to go find a knothol or someth . . . ; p but i will admit , there was just one scene where i was surpris at the outcom ( hint : it involv the evil guy and miss crap comeback ) . as for the plot , i'm still tri to find one . this movi was basic an excus to get a boatload of peopl into danger territori where they could get snarf by ridicul , computer-gener anaconda with the eye and fang of viper and the faster-than-grav downward acceler of a harrier jet . ( harrier snake ? ) not to mention instant digest so they could go snarf countless other victim . the writer tri to throw in some sort of plot twist ( should i call it a plot knot becaus it made no sens ? ) in which the sick guy g-friend kiss the evil dude and sudden everybodi hate said evil dude and start tri to kill him . that was about as clear and understand as mission : imposs . ( if someon could explain that movi to me , i'd be most grate ! all the old-guy doubl agent look the same ! ! ) i wasn't inspir by the act , save for the evil dude . i can't blame the actor , though . it not their fault they had a cruddi script to work with . this conclud rydain diatrib on a shameless exploit ( and perpetu ! ) of public fear of snake . comment , flame , anyon ? -rydain the atom chees , fresh from chernobyl dairi !

0 a disappoint biographi about the homosexu relationship of two famous 19th centuri french poet . the film manag to remov all the poetri from the poet and instead concentr on their abras person . the result is mere an academ exercis , leav an emot vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poet they were . on paper , this shouldn't have been so terribl -- it had a talent director in agnieszka holland ( " the secret garden " ) , a proven screenwrit in christoph hampton ( danger liaison ) , and a capabl cast . but the film was done in by it inept script , the unapp way the film was direct , and the miscast of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . i found his perform to be the most risibl one in the film , with him act more like a teenag brat than a young genius , spout obsen without give a hint that a true poet lie behind that facad . he , especi , look bad becaus david thewli as paul verlain look so good despit the turgid dialogu that was thrust upon him and how thin a charact he was forc to be . but when the two of them were togeth , it look like a mismatch . leonardo rimbaud onli made the young poet look petul and crude , yet we know from rimbaud poetri , that he must have had someth go for him becaus his poetri was awe inspir . the film open in post-revolutionari franc in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the establish symbolist poet verlain a letter with his poem . he accept verlain prais and invit to be a hous guest in his splendid pari home , and rimbaud leav his sullen farm in rural charlevill . onc there , rimbaud is disappoint in the bourgeoisi household , has an immedi conflict with verlain busti 18-year-old wife mathild ( roman ) , and find to his regret that the drunken verlain love his rich wife for her bodi and that he live off her famili money , even though he has noth els in common with her . when verlain state , " poet can learn from one anoth , " rimbaud repli in a haughti tone , " onli if they'r bad poet . " he will continu to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship . verlain prove to be weak-wil , beat his wife regular , and play just as despic a charact as rimbaud . when mathild father kick rimbaud out of the hous , verlain find him in a room hous and the two becom lover . it a real downer to watch this stori unfold into a seri of obnoxi behavior pattern on the part of the two poet , which lead them to travel togeth and mathild ask for a divorc . in brussel , verlain get arrest for sodomi and spend two year in jail . while rimbaud becom anger at the literari world and never write anoth poem after he becom 19 . he instead goe to north africa and becom an adventur and a gun-runn , and after ten year there , come home with a tumor on his knee and die a chang man at the age of 37 . the hopeless relationship between the two is what the pictur cover in detail and that was not veri satisfi . the film end on a whimper . . . with verlain talk with rimbaud sister about her brother and the poem of his he still possess , which the sister want destroy so as not to embarrass the famili or ruin the name of her deceas brother if publish . this film was especi annoy becaus rimbaud poem are fill with a visionari tens that are not even approach in this film , as the film onli manag to skim the surfac of the live of these poet and complet ignor the valu of their poetri . i have no idea what the filmmak was tri to say in this film , but whatev it was , it just didn't work . it certain didn't bring ani light into understand what rimbaud meant to modern poetri and whi he earn the reput as the so-cal father of modern poetri .
1 befor you read my review , you gotta know that i love woodi allen . this is a veri import note becaus allen film are general an acquir tast and definit not for everyon . i know folk who believ him to be a complet genius , while other see him as a dirti ol schnook who keep make the same movi over and over again . i love most of his film , but will admit to have been quit disappoint by his recent crop dure the 90s . in fact , whi he felt the need to make 10 movi in those 10 year is beyond me ! if you look at the qualiti of those film , you'll hear what i'm say . the onli two film of his that i realli like dure that time were bullet over broadway and husband and wive . in fact , i secret hope that he would take some " time off " at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energ or someth , but it doesn't appear as though he has ani intent of do that . so here i am again , review yet anoth woodi allen movi and hope that it bring back the woodi from the day of old . plot : the year is 1940 and woodi allen is a top-notch insur investig . his method are veri old-fashion and appar out of date . a new employe ( hunt ) has just been hire to streamlin the oper for greater effici . the two do not like each other . one night , they are both put under a hypnot tranc by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , place under his control . soon thereaft , jewel are stolen , word of love are exchang and everyon is look for an answer . critiqu : a wonder recreat of the 1940s style movi , with the fast-talk witti banter between co-work , a catchi jazz score move thing along , film noirish element such as the veronica lake-typ sexpot , one-lin galor and a fluffi , if inconsequenti plotlin . on the downsid , the film actual start off pretti slowli , with the first hour toss onli a few guffaw out there , but never realli generat ani kind of steadi flow or energi . the set , on the other hand , were amaz , the product design and costum were perfect , and the cast ideal , so i kept hope that the film would pick up and not turn into yet anoth mediocr outing for the man . but it wasn't not long befor i was fulli engag by the charact , entertain by the mani zinger deliv back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actual interest in the resolut of the flick . i also appreci how allen play the fine line between homag to the film of old , parodi and actual reinvent ( note theron entir femal persona that is drench in film noir- veri cool ) . of cours , film like this ( with littl or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actor to keep you interest in the quick-fir dialogu , and onc again , allen doe a great job in play his charact , who for onc , isn't his typic new york jewish neurot cheat insecur husband dude . he actual play a " macho " guy here and handl it pretti well , especi the scene in which he hypnot . but the bigger surpris for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was open " sick of see " in movi late last year ( sorri babe , you were just in too mani at the same time ! ) . anyway , she realli great in this film as the headstrong woman look to a new era of equal amongst men , and doesn't miss a beat of allen fast-pac dialogu . i didn't care much for her run joke about him " die " whenev he left a room , but overal she was realli good and i especi like the way that her sweater clung to her breast as they did . . . yum , yum ! harumph , but i digress . so let recap . a great look pictur with a nice jazzi score , some funni one-lin , especi in the second half , a decent plotlin , although you shouldn't expect a real mysteri or anyth , and some solid act all around . i can't say that this is even remot close to ani of allen best work , but i certain believ it to be a step in the right direct , especi after the dinki decad of film that he just went through . it probabl better gear toward allen fan more than anyon els , but i would still recommend this film to anyon look for a cute , " old-school " kind of vibe , with chemistri between the lead , zippi dialogu and a satisfi conclus . littl known fact about this film and it star : anni hall ( 10/10 ) - celebr ( 5/10 ) - everyon say i love you ( 5/10 ) - husband and wive ( 9/10 ) - mighti aphrodit ( 5/10 ) - small time crook ( 7/10 ) - when harri met salli ( 10/10 ) - you'v got mail ( 4/10 )
1 if there is one thing that bother me about hollywood film it their predict end . the devil advoc has the atyp hollywood end , when everyth that should happen doe . unfortun for the devil advoc , this end near collaps in on itself , and ruin the entir film . nevertheless , the film doe provid two and a half hour of pure entertain ( note to self : kill whomev was in charg of the preview for this film ) . i don't think i was quit prepar for this movi becaus the trailer made it appear to be some supernatur horror film about satan . well , it doe contain this element , but what is not mention in the ad is the other plot element ( and seem more interest one at that ) . the devil advoc begin in florida with an ongo trial in session . kevin lomax ( keanu reev ) is the defens attorney , work for a client whom has been accus of rape a young girl . he end up with a not-guilti verdict , despit an emot testimoni from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . he leav the courthous with his love wife mari ann ( charliz theron ) where he is approach with an offer to travel to new york citi to help choos a good juri . he accept ( main after see the paycheck he will receiv ) and he fli to new york with his wife . after prove his worth for select juri ( and his perfect win streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , ask him to work perman as a crimin lawyer . he gracious accept , where he is treat almost as a god . he is given an incred apart ( which is bigger than my entir hous now ) , and a hefti paycheck . his life seem to be on the rise . and of cours , his life sudden begin to waver and slowli declin . he is attract to fellow employe christabella ( conni nielson ) , and his wife begin to feel veri lone in her larg apart . mari ann take up a friendship with a neighbor who alway give advic , especi if it is not want . meanwhil , kevin nab a case surround alexand cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who appar murder three peopl . he spend hour upon hour with this case , while forget his love wife , who may or may not be go insan . all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . after a while , thing turn complet upside-down , as kevin wife claim to have seen monstrous imag superimpos on her friend . a fellow employe is murder in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveal inform about kevin real father . is it all just a big nightmar ? or is john milton realli satan , play trick with kevin life ? the devil advoc play out fair straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwrit want to surpris everyon by give us someth we don't expect . is this surpris conclus suppos to make us feel good and go home without feel depress or disturb ? if so , the devil advoc mess up complet , and iron , i felt more depress becaus of the end as is now , than i would have if it had end ten minut earli . i went into the devil advoc expect a shock horror film , and that is exact what i got . i was settl in to be disturb mental and emot , and that is what i got . but what was the most disturb and horribl aspect of the movi is the poor end ( did i mention that i didn't like the end ? ) . the produc of this film take you on a thrill roller coaster ride and just as it is end , they pull the rug out from under you . film like se7en and the usual suspect can surviv with this surpris end becaus it is expect , more or less . we know it is go to end in an unpredict way . the devil advoc , on the other hand , end unpredict , not from us know a lot , but know noth at all . if that is confus , i recommend watch the film , and then read that again . as for the film overal , i enjoy the entir first two hour , be drawn in by a terrif charact studi and then ad the supernatur plot to increas the tension build from the charact studi . the film run like a well-built clock , slowli build until final explod with a high charg climax ( and an unpredict one at that ) . and then you settl in for a nice resolut , which doe not occur . it was at this point that i felt cheat . take us on a terror ride of intrigu , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiec of the film . everyth occur from his perspect . he is our represent on screen ( sort of ) . but we are forc to wit a conclus which make most of the film seem like a game . i don't want to spoil the end , so all i can say is go see the film and decid for yourself . perhap the most shock thing about the devil advoc is the extrem amount of everyth . it earn it r rate for a reason . there is plenti of nuditi , sex , violenc , gore , and then you have gore , violenc , sex , and more nuditi . this film realli isn't subtl about anyth , show us everyth . it actual surpris me that this film did not receiv an nc-17 rate , as it is quit harsh . howev , the movi doe have it merit , and nuditi and sex are among those . i don't condon sex and nuditi in film , but if it there , i might as well enjoy it . the biggest merit of this film is also the most interest to watch . the confront between kevin lomax and john milton are entertain , but what stand out amidst this extrem hatr is the declin of the wife , mari ann . portray by the extrem effect charliz theron , mari ann problem are incred intens , and i found myself want to wit her declin . this may sound uncar , but i want to watch becaus i felt sorri for her . she is the most interest charact on the screen , who is forc into a world where she is not want . someth the devil advoc contain actual shock me for reason other than extrem violenc and nuditi , especi for a film of this natur . the stori actual has someth to say about human . in one of the last scene , john milton explain to kevin lomax the game god play with his children ( he is satan , of cours ) . he comment that it is human natur to lust and loath in vaniti . then , god set up rule which contradict human natur . this semi-religi bash is more humor than frighten . what milton say is so true about our societi that i found myself laugh out loud , partial think it was funni , but patial realiz it was true . these moral dilemma are present throughout the devil advoc , give it an ad depth mani film skip over in their write ( but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was base on ) . when a film has someth to say about our societi , it deserv to be watch . the cast of the devil advoc is one of the highlight , as we see memor face , and they put spin on those memor face we don't expect . heather matarazzo make a brief appear as the terror victim in the open court case , and she doe a great job . probabl the big surpris of this film is keanu reev . he has proven himself an uneven actor ( success such as speed and bomb such as johnni mnemon ) , but he top himself with this perform . i have never seen him more believ to date . al pacino is of cours the scene stealer . his devilish perform is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witch of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( need thing ) . he could have easili gone too far over the top in mani scene , but he remain complet believ ( if that is the correct term ) . jeffrey jone ( most known as the princip in ferri bueller day off ) also give a good perform as eddi barzoon . judith ivey manag a credibl perform as the mother who hold a secret to kevin past . conni nielson is veri effect in her role , and she also appear nake sever time . one familiar face with a twist was " coach " star , craig t . nelson , who give a veri good perform . the devil advoc is rate r for sexual , nuditi , violenc , languag , and some gore . at 144 minut , this film move along fair quick . for the first two hour , i sat complet engag in the good perform and strong charact . the technic qualiti is also remark , with great special effect and a good music score . director taylor hackford has manag to creat a veri disturb motion pictur , onli to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minut . i guess my biggest problem with the

( " look into my eye ! " ) in fact , the last time that i'v seen a guy so scare in a movi was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brother miller cross . scari shite . but there an ever better scene than that in this film . this one featur bettani , onc again , slowli tortur , hack and beat the live piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man point-of-view ) , but not befor turn on a quaint littl tune in the background and remov all of his own expens cloth , one by one ( that right , he " doe " the guy in his underwear ) . that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerot underton present throughout this film , especi in the relationship between bettani and his boss ( whi doe he get so upset when he fall in love with that woman ? ) . but the flick not perfect . in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowel voice-ov narrat at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is present as such ) , he came in everi now and then , and rare ad anyth of interest to the plot . all he seem to do was swear and call peopl the c-word umpteen time , and even describ one scene as it was happen ( " . . . so i open the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . .

0 star : armand assant ( mike hammer ) , barbara carrera ( dr . charlott bennett ) , lauren landon ( velda ) , alan king ( charl kalecki ) , geoffrey lewi ( joe butler ) , paul sorvino ( detect pat chamber ) , judson scott ( charl hendrick ) , barri snider ( romero ) , julia barr ( norma child ) / mpaa rate : r / review : in the 1982 updat of mickey spillan 1947 novel " i , the juri , " hard-boil detect mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drive a shini bronz tran am , dress like don johnson in " miami vice " with less pastel , and has sworn off alcohol . howev , he still smoke his lucki strike , detest all form of author , and kill at a whim . beyond that , the updat film retain littl or no resembl to the origin pulpi page-turn by spillan , probabl the most infam and often revil of all mysteri writer . the movi start off with a bang : a howler of an open credit sequenc that is a cheap steal from the jame bond seri , complet with cheesi graphic and an overbear jazz score by bill conti ( " rocki " ) . after that , the movi and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack william ( frederick down ) , a one-arm detect and hammer best friend . hammer declar that he will seek vengeanc for jack death , and with the help of his devot secretari , the blond and shape velda ( lauren landon ) , and the altern friend / antagonist polic chief pat chamber ( paul sorvino ) , he is immedi on the killer trail . here the movi split complet from the book , and dive into a convolut and improb tale of govern conspiraci and mind control tactic involv the mafia , the cia , one of hammer vietnam vet buddi , and a kinki sex clinic . mani of the same charact from the book appear in the movi , but they take on slight differ role . for instanc , charl kalecki ( alan king ) , a number runner and narcot dealer in the book , turn into a suav mob boss . and , more import , hammer suspici love interest , charlott bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morph from a run-of-the-mil psychiatrist into the coordin and founder of the sex clinic . " i , the juri " is one of sever cinemat rendit of spillan book ( includ a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differ from those earlier version in one major way : it includ all of the sex and violenc spillan wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood product code . although this take the 1982 version of " i , the juri " closer to the core of the origin subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film receiv the most critic , becaus it took this new licens to extrem that mani argu surpass what was in the book . rest assur , the movi not onli includ a great deal of nuditi , but it is thorough violent , especi toward women . it featur one woman have her neck slash , a set of twin forc to strip befor be stab to death by a psychot sexual deviant program by the cia ( judson scott ) , and anoth woman shot point-blank in the belli by hammer himself . no one would deni that spillan write has a definit misogynist natur , but the movi seem to take it a step further by give it such glorious screen treatment ; it constant equat of sex and violenc , much of which is play with the intent of be erot , is quit unsettl . it no surpris that the movi , like the book , fade to black with a dead woman on the floor . " i , the juri " had a troubl product and was not well-support by the studio that made it , which is one explan whi it didn't do well in theater and mani peopl have forgotten that it was ever made . the script was written by larri cohen , who is best known for his creativ cheesi but nonetheless effect monster movi , like " it aliv " ( 1974 ) and it two sequel , " q " ( 1981 ) , and " the stuff " ( 1985 ) . cohen wrote the script think he was go to helm the project as well , but he was yank from the director chair after onli a week worth of shoot becaus he was alreadi $100 , 000 over budget . he was quick replac by richard t . heffron , who has work for the last three decad on a hand of undistinguish movi and dozen of televis project . heffron was obvious brought in not for his talent , but becaus he could make the movi rapid and effici . it show in the final product . cohen had person interest in the updat version of hammer , but heffron has none . he shot the movi quick and clumsili , and although some scene ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invari dull . the movi featur numer car chase , shoot-out , and stunt , but heffron background in televis is the domin tone ; despit the graphic violenc and full-front nuditi , " i , the juri , " take on the air of a made-for-tv quicki , with no real punch or depth . but the problem in " i , the juri " run deeper than the technic . the central fault in this updat is mike hammer , whose charact was lost in the shuffl while updat from the fifti to the eighti . becaus spillan wrote all his hammer mysteri in the first person , hammer charact is central to the tale becaus all the event are filter through his persona . we never realli get that impress in the movi -- there is no first-person voice-ov narrat and some scene don't have hammer in them at all . consequ , a great deal of the textur of spillan storytel is lost . the period updat turn out to be a detriment bad idea becaus much of hammer moral code is thrown to the wind . despit his character as a hard-nos , violent , misogynist killer , hammer alway stuck fervent to his own moral code . the titl itself , " i , the juri , " refer to his anti-establish notion of be his own law . unlik privat eye who seek out the bad guy and then turn them over the polic , hammer both pursu the crimin and exact the punish . in this way , he can be seen as " abov the law , " but he still adher strict to her own person code of conduct , his own moral . the movi forgo that aspect of his charact , and hammer come off not onli as amor in societi term , but in ani term , especi his own . if anyth , hammer alway had his profession , but the movi doe away with that in the first three minut by show him roll in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was be unfaith . mayb the scene was intend for laugh , but it onli cheapen hammer charact and is , by all account , a lousi way to start the movi . the blame for hammer charact can't be laid on assant shoulder , becaus despit some unnecessari marlon brandon-lik mumbl , he deliv a fine perform . spillan never onc describ hammer physic attribut in ani of the dozen book in which he appear , so ani actor could conceiv portray him . of cours , becaus of the lack of written descript , those who have read spillan book will have a strong person notion of what hammer look like , and therefor almost ani screen incarn will somehow fall short of expect ( spillan , who play the charact himself in 1963 " the girl hunter , " is general consid the best of the film hammer ) . the rest of actor are most un-noteworthi . with the except of alan king and paul sorvino , everyon who appear in " i , the juri " were up-and-com who basic went nowher . mani of them end up work in televis ( like carrera , who had a short stint on " dalla " in the mid-eighti ) , which onli add to the made-for-tv atmospher of the film . mayb someday , someon will manag to get the right element togeth and make an effect film rendit of a spillan book , but this is certain not it .
0 what would inspir someon who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movi ? a better question , what would inspir a studio to produc said movi ? if you have an answer , let me know . foolish , the new movi written by and star master p is a jaw-drop horribl film , one with no redeem valu social , cinemat or otherwis . comed it has some potenti , but onli in it stand-up comedi moment , which i can turn on comedi central for . master p star as fifti dollah ( beat that ! ) as a mobster ( i think ) who is tri to start a comedi club/act with his littl brother foolish ( eddi griffin ) . but the two of them have to deal with an angri mob boss ( play by andrew dice clay , for the veri first time entertain ) , a stubborn club owner and famili problem ( the latter in foolish is a perfect exampl of roger ebert " idiot plot , " if everyon here wasn't an idiot , there would be no problem ) so what doe foolish have to offer besid a bunch of idiot charact name ? not a hell of a lot . as i have mention , master p cannot act or write . he act like the rapper that he is . the occasion despair that his script requir him to exhibit is excruci forc , as are his warm and fuzzi scene with his littl bro . as for his script -- well , i suppos he deliv what one would expect from a music artist with no previous screenwrit experi . if you haven't yet figur it out , that is not say much . co-star eddi griffin ( realli the star of the show ) is quit a differ stori . the fact of the matter is that griffin , whose most signific screen outing to date is probabl the mild success tv show malcolm and eddi on the fledgl upn network , is an extrem talent comedian , stand-up and otherwis . he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour , money talk ) in how quick and effortless his speech flow from his lip . he spout profan with impress dexter ( to the extent which that can be done ) , and while i hope that doe not becom his trademark it work in a few scene in this movi . and inde , i laugh at a few stand-up scene here , but from a feature-length movi i expect more . foolish provid me with no reason to care for these charact . everi scene which has ani potenti for dramat impact is effect diffus by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escal between the two brother , foolish blurt out toward his jewelry-sport sibl " you lay one hand on me and this cemetari is go to be a gold rush " ) or someth even more idiot such as foolish smash his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loud for the occas " huh ? " ) after get slight upset with his wife . believ me when i say that there is noth in foolish that warrant part with your hard-earn $8 . you'll get more laugh from watch 30 minut of comedi central or ani virtual ani sitcom if you don't have cabl . eddi griffin fan may enjoy this deriv ( although offens ) yarn , but everyon els should stay the hell away . &#137 ;

1 robert redford is veri good at play charact who have incred , god-given gift , but are abl to act like ordinari peopl . in " the natur " ( 1984 ) , he play the fallen angel charact of roy hobb , the basebal player who was destin to be " the best there ever was , " but still act like a humbl farm boy . in " butch cassidi and the sundanc kid " ( 1969 ) , he was the most danger shot in the west , yet he came off like a noth more than a boyish good-look charmer . even in " indec propos " ( 1993 ) , where he play a man who was so good at make money that he believ he could buy love , redford was still abl to exud an aura of shi decenc , especi when recit a tale of lost love . in his latest film , " the hors whisper , " base on the best-sel novel by nichola evan , redford again play such a charact . redford also direct the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movi - i suppos the charact of tom booker , a man who has the amaz gift of understand and somehow communic with hors , was just too good to pass up . despit his enorm and rare gift when it come to train troubl hors ( a magazin articl coin the phrase " hors whisper " to describ his uncanni talent ) , booker see himself as an everyday cattl rancher whose greatest fear is grow old and no longer have a purpos in life . booker talent are tax into servic by anni maclean ( kristin scott thoma ) , a new york magazin editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recent in a horribl accid . the accid , which is film with gut-wrench horror , happen when grace and her best friend are out ride hors - an eighteen-wheel kill grace friend , sever wound and traumat grace hors , pilgrim , and caus grace to lose part of her right leg . anni believ that if pilgrim can be heal , grace will be heal as well , which lead her to booker . at first , she tri to get booker to come to new york to see the hors , but that doesn't work . instead , she pack up grace and pilgrim , leav her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and head for the roll hill of montana where booker run a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , dian ( diann wiest ) . in mani way , the film is like a journey , both liter and symbol . the move out west has alway been a great american tradit of renew , and it hard not to see anni and grace leav manhattan for montana as a variat on the classic theme of citi vs . countri . in " the hors whisper , " countri is clear the victor . the citi is character by claustrophobia and unhappi , and it is not until the charact arriv in the wide-open space of montana that grace anger at be physic and emot crippl begin to dissip , anni control natur begin to relax , and pilgrim onc again learn to trust peopl . redford is just as in love with the grand montana countri in this film as he was when he direct " a river run through it " six year ago . in mani way , " the hors whisper " come from the same poetic vein as " river , " and the movi could probabl be a good fifteen minut shorter if redford had decid to spend less camera-tim on the grass and mountain . but then , that would ruin the magic . much of the film photographi is truli eleg , and it creat a palpabl sens of the sheer expans of the land . to further emphas this , redford and cinematograph robert richardson ( " natur born killer , " " platoon " ) cheat a bit by shoot the begin of the film - which take place in new york - with most cold , harsh bluish filter and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shift to montana , richardson switch to soft-focus and natur light , and the screen widen to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . in term of the stori itself , " the hors whisper " give us the same romantic view of adulteri found in david lean " a brief encount " ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood 1995 adapt of robert jame waller " the bridg of madison counti " ( richard lagravenes , co-screenwrit here also adapt " bridg " ) . although " the hors whisper " has a strong romant sensibl , i still find someth odd troubl about this kind of stori . it seem to me that there should be some sympathi for the husband who be left behind for this brief , heart-sweep affair , but there rare is . in " the hors whisper , " the thankless role of be the fuddy-duddi husband fall to sam neill . he play the charact as a decent , hard-work man who is a good husband and father ; his onli failur is that he love his wife more than she love him . he is at risk of lose anni to booker not becaus he did anyth to drive her away , but simpli becaus he happen to be a normal , fair uninspir man . there is one scene that is particular tell of how the movi feel about each charact . it show booker and robert go into a hors pen - booker is dress like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert look somewhat frumpi and out-of-plac in a basebal cap . as they enter the pen , booker assur swing over the fenc , while robert hesit , then open the gate and , in a goofi moment , forget to close it behind him . it a small scene , but it clear demonstr the movi thorough love of the booker charact for his romant rough . after all , booker repres everyth good about the citi while robert repres everyth banal and unnatur about it . the best scene in " the hors whisper " tend to involv not the build romanc between booker and anni , but rather the heal process of grace and her hors . although booker horse-train method are mythic and unrealist , the scene with him and pilgrim are strang mesmer . these are parallel by the scene between him and grace , some of which are humor , and all of which are tender and true . at some point , i wish the movi would drop the whole romanc angl and focus on grace more . nevertheless , redford is obvious a romant at heart , and he bring a light touch to the erot moment in the film . there are no dramat sex scene , but there is a move scene when he and scott thoma are slow-danc , alway move ever closer togeth , that is far more erot than ani scene of sweati bodi grind togeth . although the movi is longer than it should be and is essenti a melodramat tearjerk with an unsatisfi conclus that guarante unhappi for just about everi charact , there are enough moment like that which make " the hors whisper " worth the price of admiss .
1 i like movi with albert brook , and i realli like movi direct and written by albert brook . lost in america and defend your life are two of my favorit comedi . his humor is of a kind that is not veri preval in movi today , inund as we are with film which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denomin . you will rare see ani slapstick in an albert brook film , while the dialog will not be as oppress as in some of the independ " talk film " which are find their way into theater . the situat in which his charact find themselv are one we can often identifi with , but even if we can't , brook has the talent to make them comfort , and therefor we laugh . teenag and jim carrey fan probabl won't find an albert brook movi veri funni , but peopl who look for more than what we could find on televis probabl will . put simpli , brook comedi is intellig . mother is albert brook latest film , and it doe not disappoint . brook play john henderson , a middle-ag scienc fiction writer just come off his second divorc . he make an attempt at date , but fail miser . he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a success sport agent who seem to live the ideal life . jeff has a good job , a love famili , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatric ( debbi reynold ) . after dinner , john wit a telephon convers between jeff and beatric , and is at the same time amaz and sicken by how hunky-dori the dialog is . in comparison , beatric alway hint at a fault in john and his career everi time she talk with him , and john give it right back to her . at the end of one of their convers where beatric has just pick apart john life , she say , " i love you , " and john repli with , " i know you think you do . " the thing is , beatric is not overt with her critic , but instead give them in that mother way which is tantamount to nit-pick and guilt load . it the kind that goe someth like , " yes , dear , i think you do that wonder , but . . . . " it seem as though noth he doe make her happi . there alway the big but . john believ that his mother is somehow connect to his fail relationship with women , either becaus of his flaw self-esteem caus by his need for valid , or perhap becaus he tend to unconsci seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedip manner . he come to the conclus that sinc his problem are root in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kind of feel come out , and by that be abl to sort out whi his life is the way it is . " a great experi " , he call it . brook own brand of humor realli shine in this film , especi in the interact john has with his mother . there a scene where john has just arriv at his mother hous , and after have driven from los angel to sausalito , and have explain to his mother about the " great experi " , beatric ask , " now explain to me again whi you don't want to stay at a hotel . " she still doesn't get it , and it is absolut hilari . in the same scene , we get littl glanc at the life his mother lead when she tri to feed him food that is no longer fresh . she appar buy in great quantiti and refriger it until the lettuc is wilt and the sherbet is ice over . when john point out the ice on the sherbet , beatric tell him not to worri about the protect glaze . " you'v name the ice ? " ask john . he also surpris at the varieti of item beatric keep in the refriger , such as a twenty-pound block of chees . " the freezer was a good invent , " say john , " but it not suppos to be use for everyth . that whi it smaller than the refriger . " it someth most of us find strang familiar . brook is also a master at employ the non sequitur . for exampl , in defend your life , his and meryl streep charact are in a comedi club have a discuss . when they'r finish and walk out , brook cut to the comic on stage who is just at the point of deliv his punch line , " and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outsid ! " you don't know what the joke was becaus you couldn't hear him dure the entir scene , but i must have laugh for the next five minut , it seem so out of context . in this film , brook use the same trick a coupl of time to open or close a scene . i don't want to give them away , but suffic it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . john purpos for stay with his mother is to learn , and we as the audienc learn right along with him . his mother is not the fascin type to begin with , but as john spend more time with her , we learn thing about her person and her lifestyl that give her depth . watch the charact of beatric unfold is everi bit as enjoy as the humor that accompani it each step of the way . on screen , brook doe an excel job play this kind of charact : you get the feel he often believ he is the onli sane person in an insan world . in a way , he veri much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with someth of an attitud . cast debbi reynold as beatric is perfect . she assum the part with eas , even move and speak a littl slowli , and is just so ador it hard to get mad at her charact . this onli help the audienc to share the frustrat john feel when deal with her . as his first choic , brook origin want to lure nanci reagan out from her act retir to play beatric , but the former actress and first ladi could not leav her husband , who was begin to show symptom of alzheim diseas . that may be just as well , sinc reynold lend a soft to the charact which enhanc it immens . rob morrow also doe a good job at play the younger brother who has alway been mother favorit and , for all his success in his job and famili , is slowli expos as a mama boy . the onli thing that hold this movi back from be better are a coupl of plot hole . a solid connect is not realli made between john troubl and his reason for live with his mother . addit , the end result of the experi do not necessarili jibe with the state goal , and although this may have been sloppi screenwrit , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : beatric : you must think i'm some kind of moron . john : no , i think your someon who think i'm a moron . beatric : well , it take one to know one .
0 star shawne smith ; donovan leitch ; ricki paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billi beck the blob is the remak of the 1960 classic ( a term that i use veri loos to defin the origin ) about a realli mean glob of goop that take out anyth that get in it way . now the origin version has the virtu of cheesi special effect which give it a kind of nostalg campi feel . the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exact hurt it either . fast forward to the late 80 . steve mcqueen isn't in the remak ( this might have someth to do with the fact that he had been push up daisi for year ) . nor is there ani hollywood heavi hitter in the lead role . that is unless you count matt dillon brother kevin as a hollywood heavi hitter . the other thing that work against this new blob is that special effect technolog has improv dramat sinc the origin . the onli thing you need now to have great special effect in a movi are deep pocket . it look as if the produc of the new blob had a coupl of hole in their pocket . the special effect in this movi are cheesi , like the origin . unlik the origin , they don't look campi , they just look cheap . one bright spot in the movi from a pure sexist point of view is shawne smith . she is veri attract and can actual act , which is more than i can say about some of her costar . in term of plot , a littl ball of pink goop fall from the sky . seem this goop was an experi that was be hous up on a satellit . anyway , the pink stuff has a tast for human . the more peopl it absorb , the bigger it get . and it isn't the friendliest goop on the block either . anyway , it attack this littl town and it up to the attract local teenag popul to stop it . not realli , but that is how it seem . this version attempt to recaptur the camp of the origin . as i'v alreadi said , this new version of the blob come off more as cheap , bad act , and bad written than campi . in the year sinc this film was made none of the cast have gone on to great . although , star shawne smith had a veri tini role in armageddon . the reason that we have never heard of ani of them again is quit simpl -- they all stunk out loud . although some of the film smaller role are fill with some actor that , while not big star , are doubtless peopl that you will recogn from their support role in other movi and tv show . it also appear that the produc of the blob tri to compens for the lack of a special effect budget by make the scene in which the blob make meal of the townsfolk as gori as possibl . sad , it doesn't work veri well . if you want to see a big ball of goop terror a town , then i would say that you should skip the remak and rent the origin . ( although that isn't so hot either . ) this newest version is serious lack in ani redeem qualiti .
1 in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyag across the atlant for america . this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . she was also build to be one of the most luxuri , and that she was . final , she was built to be unsink and that unfortun she was not . to get a ticket for this voyag you either : spent a life save to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or final were lucki enough to have a full hous in a poker match by the dock like jack dawson . jack dawson make the trip , and happen to be at the right place at the right time . rose dewitt bukat , a first class passeng , climb the rail at the aft of the ship with thought of jump . thus is start a tale of romanc and intrigu , and a tale of death and tragedi . . . this movi is about a tragic event that took place a great mani year ago , an even that should not be taken light as ani other bit of histor trivia . the movi titan show what happen , mayb not with a 100% degre of accuraci , but it still show it veri realisticali . now the titan is both a stori on it own and a backdrop for a stori . it serv as both admir , brine forth an interest stori that although simpl in it most simpl premis is veri captiv . this movi is veri emot simpli becaus of what it is , but that alon is not enough . the stori is brought out with a certain style that make is so much more emot and so much more effect . movi such as this will not be forgotten all too quick and unfortun then are not someth that is produc by hollywood with ani great frequenc . the attent to detail that was paid is remark . the whole premis for the tell of the stori is interest , with the show of brand new footag from the wreck of the titan ad much flavor to an alreadi good movi . part of the magic chemistri behind this stori is the act , and for this movi it extrem good act from the whole cast . the perform put in by the main star is someth to be admir . the charact were play out so memor that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receiv at the least nomin for their role . look at the act done in the movi it seem as if they aren't act but are actual the charact in the movi . the cast for the movi could realli have been better , in my humbl opinion that is . one charact that will most like not be mention by ani other review or commentari about this film is that of the ship itself . yes , you read correct , the ship is a charact . how is the titan a charact ? you ask well simpl , a ship had a certain charact about it and as most sailor and boat men will tell you . this charact is everyth about the ship from it specif to it luxuri and the titan was no stranger to this . mr . cameron bring the ship to life in an almost liter sens . all this add to the movi in a certain way that most hollywood product cant seem to grasp . now , to produc the effect that i mention abov and to sink the ship itself are feat that are accomplish by special effect wizard . the effect in this movi rang from marvel costum to beauti render scene of the ship sink . in some respect you cannot tell that the effect are there , you simpli think that what you see is what happen or what is happen ( if your imagin is good ) . the technic wizardri done in this movi is just spectacular and actual get new footag from the wreck of the titan is uniqu . the movi will leav you amaz at the effect , and that is a feat sinc there is no monster or alien in this movi , just human and an overs ship . the movi will amaz you and it will pull on your emot , the theater that i went to had a few peopl leav with tear in their eye . now that is not a feat accomplish by most movi , now the fact that the tragedi actual occur is brought home with someth of a punch , i wont spoil the end and say what happen regardless it is an interest movi from begin to the veri end . the histor valu of this movi is quit high , and honest is someth that should be watch for the sake of see it and see the tragedi , for it is extrem well done . the method of tell the stori is also good , mayb not total uniqu but effect none the less . regardless of anyth mention abov this movi is a grandios product and the sheer size of the project undertaken is someth to be marvel at . the simpl fact that the movi is smash success at what it aim to achiev is just astonish . if you get the chanc to see this movi go ! ! ! it might not be the best movi in the world . . but it rank fair high and is well worth the time spent watch it . dure none of the 3 hour and 13 minut of the movi are you bore nor doe your attent wane from the movi .

1 citi of angel is the kind of love stori that i enjoy the most : thought-provok , move , and complet unsentiment . i find it interest that this film has been releas the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undon complet by it wretch sentiment . citi of angel is a wonder film , enhanc by interest and well-round charact and some of the most immers imageri of the last coupl of year . it a love stori that take the familiar angel theme and make them new and necessari to the stori , and avoid most of the clich we'r so use to see in film like this . citi of angel is an appar loos remak of wim wender 1988 film wing of desir . i have yet to see wing of desir , so i am , unfortun , unabl to make a comparison of the two . i have heard , howev , that citi of angel is dissimilar from the origin in numer way , which make me glad that this film isn't a rip-off of it sourc materi . nicola cage star as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterpart , is present to lead the die to heaven ( or somewher just like it ) . one day , he is forc to take the life of a patient of dr . maggi rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attent is call to her . the angel can make themselv seen to human , but they can't experi ani of the sens ( most import , touch ) . he show himself to maggi , and she fall for him , unawar that he is slight unavail becaus of his apparit status . seth want to becom human so he can feel her . that when he meet nathaniel messing ( denni franz ) , " former celesti messeng and recent addit to the human race . " ( as a side note , i found messing to be the most fascin charact , for i can onli imagin how incred liber it must be to live know what lie beyond death . ) messing explain to seth that it is possibl for angel to becom human . seth manag to convinc maggi that he is an angel ( i know , it sound ridicul , but the scene in which she find out is except well-don ) ; after much deliber , she tell him that she could onli be with a man who can feel . this , of cours , is when seth decid to take the plung ( liter ) from a build ; when he wake up from the fall , he is human , and happi to feel what it like to have a split lip and blood ooz from his forehead . sinc i love this film so much , i'll make a minor note that it certain isn't perfect . although it is origin and mesmer , it doe fall prey to a few of the clich of the genr . the plot of the stori by writer dawn steel is rather formula ( though the detail are what make the stori excel , and steel has done a great job with them ) . the end , too , could have been more power and less predict . these element are minor , though , and bare detract from my overal enjoy of citi of angel . the act is superb from everyon involv . this is perhap my second-favorit perform from cage ( my favorit be the rock ) . he quiet and pensiv , and his eye are engag when he speak his softly-ton word . he perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassur us he not bound by play the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he show in face/off ) . meg ryan is a power , entic , and appealingly-chirpi actress , and her work here is some of her best . denni franz , howev , steal all of his scene as the energet former-angel . what i admir most about citi of angel is it overal present . director brad silberl is a talent man , and he know that a stori like this is driven by the charact , rather than forc sentiment . his direct is steadi , and he show this in just about everi scene : near the begin , maggi has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . there is no music or elabor camera work ; we simpli see the reaction of the charact to the inform . this is the way stori should be told , and the strength of scene reson more complet when the emot are real . the film also appeal to the sens in a way that few love stori do . cinematograph john seal ( the english patient ) provid some of the most stun imag i'v seen on the big screen : hundr of black-clad angel stand on a dim beach in the earli morn hour ( just as an exampl ) . the music , by gabriel yare ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it quiet and moodi music ( but not sentiment ! ) , and add to the atmospher and tone nice . the visual present of citi of angel is easili the best of 1998 so far . all of this add up to a film that is instant set apart from other member of this genr . it a film that reli on charact develop and imageri to get the stori across--th excel actor and the profession product valu make citi of angel one of those rare film that both entertain and instig thought simultan .
1 richard gere is not one of my favorit actor . howev , i like courtroom drama , and this film look good enough to take a chanc on . i wasn't disappoint . it wasn't a great film , but it was interest , and took sever unexpect turn . one thing : what with the titl ? not onli is it extrem forgett , it doesn't realli have much to do with the film , as far as i could determin . in the long run , it will probabl hurt the film , as peopl won't be abl to think of or rememb it . martin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandios defens attorney . he love the money and the fame that go along with defend ( success ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-deal . onc he see that the accus killer of a promin chicago archbishop is a baby-fac alter boy , he want in on the case , presum for the press he'll get . we soon find out that the prosecutor assign is a former lover , janet venabl ( laura linney ) . vail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit becaus of tension between himself and the district attorney , play veri well by john mahoney ( frasier father on the tv seri ) . there is an under theme of dichotomi in the movi : peopl have public face , and privat face . we see this in the murder archbishop , in the accus , and , most strong , defens attorney martin vail . richard gere doe a fair good job . at first , he appear to be a money- and attention-grab lawyer , with no consider of the truth . but we see anoth side , as he becom a seeker of justic , and come to believ in his client . alfr woodard , as the judg , is capabl , though somewhat wast in a standard role . laura linney also doe journeyman work ; noth spectacular , but accept . her relationship with vail is believ ; their verbal fenc add to the film . the actor who play vail investig ( unfortun , i don't rememb his name ) is quit good . his femal assist ( she look veri familiar , but i can't rememb where i'v seen her ) was also capabl , but unspectacular . the best perform in the film was by edward norton . he was excel , as the timid altar-boy turn alleg " butcher boy of st . mike " . i was impress by the depth of the plot ; there are red-her , and dead-end , that in a lesser film would lead to a predict end . i like the plot twist the film took , and most of the support charact , thus i give primal fear a respect b+ rate .
1 the laserman : somehow the titl of writer-director-produc peter wang film conjur up imag of superhero , like ultraman and spiderman . you kind of expect an adventur flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beam from his fingertip . as it turn out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beam , but there aren't ani superhero . instead , wang film is popul by a group of refresh off-beat charact live in the ultim cultur melt pot : new york citi . the laserman is a comic brew which celebr ethnic , eccentr , and electr . the film tell the bizarr stori of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becom incred hectic after he accident kill his lab assist in an experi . he lose his job but find work with a mysteri compani which secret plan to use laser technolog to commit dastard deed . arthur profession life is clutter with moral dilemma . his person life , on the other hand , is clutter with color friend and quirki relat . in fact , arthur is by far the blandest charact in the film , despit a charismat perform by hayashi ( the san francisco-bas actor whose film includ chan is miss and the karat kid ii ) . it the auxiliari charact who give the laserman it uniqu spark . arthur not-so-typ jewish mother , ruth , for exampl , is convinc that a chines soul is trap in her jewish bodi . she has dy her red hair black , she take herbal medicin daili , and she is perpetu cook up strang delicaci , such as matzo ball in soy sauce--th ultim fusion of jewish and chines cuisin . veteran stage actress joan copeland take the part and run with it , almost steal the movi in the process . she play ruth as a driven woman , determin to overcom her genet heritag by immers herself in chines cultur . arthur girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooki free-spirit who would rather medit than copul ; her ultim goal is orgasm through zen medit . arthur best friend , joey ( toni leung ) , is a small time thief who hustl everyth from microwav oven to machin gun . joey is marri to arthur jewish sister , but he is also have an affair with a chines immigr who work in a whore hous . arthur 11-year-old son , jimmi , play by the amaz ador david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! he find it imposs to meet his father lofti expect . the various peopl in arthur life come togeth to form a rich tapestri of human . like wang earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco famili visit relat in china ) , the laserman revolv around cultur differ . everi charact in the film is , in some way or anoth , tri to find his identity--struggl to negoti a balanc between his nativ cultur and the american way . the movi also offer a provoc look at technolog . wang appear in the movi as lieuten lu , a detect who is fed up with machin , even though he reli on them to do his job . the film view technolog with a wari eye , acknowledg it necess while at the same time realiz it potenti danger . wang rais the time-honor question of whether scientist should be held respons for their invent . was einstein respons for the a-bomb ? is arthur weiss respons for his laser ? the movi pit spiritu against technolog , man against machin , and the result is a draw . accord to the film , technolog has it place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . iron , by it veri natur , the laserman is a triumph of technology--th technolog of filmmak . wang direct is exquisit , especi dure the tens final in which the director frantic cross-cut between the various subplot , perhap in homag to d . w . griffith . cinematograph ernest dickerson , who has work on all of spike lee film , give the laserman a distinct , artist look . mason dare score , which includ a send-up of bach , is right on target . the laserman is an ambiti endeavor , which is to be applaud , but it sometim ambiti to a fault . wang serv up so mani slice of life in the film that it hard to digest them all . for instanc , one charact ( arthur sister ) has neglig screen time , and consequ we just don't care about her marit problem . in weav his web , wang has includ a few too mani strand . overal , howev , the laserman is a charm eclect concoct . on the surfac , the film is a light and bounci comedy-thril , overflow with whimsic humor and visual style . the heavier issu emerg onli when you take a deeper look at the film . you can ponder the moral question or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurd of life in china town .

0 stephen , pleas post if appropri . " mafia ! " - crime isn't a funni busi by homer yen ( c ) 1998 on a particular night when i found myself have some free time , i had a chanc to either go to sleep earli or to see " mafia ! " , a spoof of mafia and crime film such as " the godfath , " " goodfella " and " casino " . at 84 minut in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laugh befor get a good night sleep . but by my account , i think that my laff-o-met onli regist a few grin , one giggl , and mayb one chortl . i suppos that you could justifi your time as homag to the vener hollywood star , lloyd bridg , who just recent pass away and whose last perform was in this film . " mafia ! " chronicl vincenzo cortino ( lloyd bridg ) life . separ from his famili when he was young , he escap to america and tri to live an honest life . but as fate would have it , vincenzo grow up to be a power and klutzi crime lord . follow in his footstep are his two son , joey ( billi burk ) and anthoni ( jay mohr ) . like all sibl in power crime famili , they squabbl over power , the futur of the famili , fortun , and women . " mafia ! " is co-written by jim abraham , who also contribut to some gut-bust funni spoof such as " airplan " and " the nake gun . " but these previous movi were funni becaus the joke seem more univers understood and there was more of a manic silli at work . as i write this , i also wonder how mani peopl have actual seen the movi on which this spoof is base . crime movi in general contain a lot of profan and violenc . it a tough genr to parodi . i was kind of hope that they could somehow spoof the profan use in all of those crime movi , mayb by have all of the tough crime lord say " pleas " as they decid which sector to take over , but this opportun was never explor . there were one or two moment that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is danc with his newli wed daughter-in-law . a gunman shoot him sever time . the impact of the bullet caus him to make these wild contort that forc the wed band to chang music style to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena . i think that i just gave away the best part of the film . oh well , that just mean that you can go to sleep a littl earlier .

1 for those who associ italian cinema with fellini and " high art , " the son room is an invent , subtl altern . written by , direct , and star nanni moretti , it take us through the slow , complic path of bereav . slow is the best descript for the film at first . it take it time in establish the habit of what appear to be a normal , happi famili . father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activ . they laugh , spend free time togeth , and reprimand the kid for innoc wrong with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . you get the feel there is open communic and uncondit love amongst the foursom . but sudden , the son is found to be dead after a dive accid . the famili dynam begin an unpredict descent that give the narrat strength when you least expect it , but can also be tri on the attent span . though the film drag and even repeat itself , this can be somewhat excus as influenc by the process of griev . though nanni moretti wore sever hat for this product , it doesn't come across as a vaniti piec . one might wish he hadn't pick the profess of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he star as ) , if onli becaus this make his charact reaction so predict . what save it is a well written script , with spare dialogu and an eclect varieti of human interact . the potenc of the film lie in the recreat of the tini detail of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relat , or that remind a depress person of loss . you start to take notic of the crack dish , ignor when famili bliss was in full swing . you rememb bond dure the routin jog around the block , and not necessarili huge event like graduat . even better are the role revers that take place within the household . while giovanni and paola ( laura morant ) do check up on their daughter iren ( jasmin trinca ) , there is a sens of be on autopilot . not onli doe iren begin to take care of her own need more , she'll make her parent breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shell to life around them . these scene provid interest portray of various cope mechan , frequent cross a boundari as to how much you can help yourself versus other dure drastic , unexpect chang . respect , gender issu never enter the pictur . self-propel isol is univers in term of deal , so moretti intellig use this tool to separ the famili . though giovanni doe stop paolo from discuss andrea at a parti with friend , there is never a sens that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restor a sens of a balanc to their live . most film that broach the topic of death util annoy melodrama , speech , and conciliatori issu to get the waterwork flow . in contrast , the son room captur a more realist depict of the effect of death on a famili by gracious flow among the five stage of mourn ( denial , depress , anger , bargain , accept ) through each of it main charact . it not the most engag 100 minut , but it is certain easi to relat to .
0 absolut power , the new film produc and direct by clint eastwood , attempt to be a thriller set in the world of hypocrit presid and their murder polit staff . it is about as thrill as a lectur on the mate habit of the south american grasshopp . one can onli wonder how an utter absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interest eastwood . not onli is the plot unbeliev and contriv , but even the write itself lack ani consist or intellig . continu underestim the audienc , the film give us inform we alreadi know or dont even need . detail essenti to the stori are so improb conveni they are annoy ( like whi would two unprepar secret servic men carri two night-vis goggl in their car ? ) . odd enough , the initi setup for absolut power offer interest possibl . a master jewel-thief ( play by clint eastwood ) wit the murder of the wife of a power millionair ( play by e . g . marshal ) . while rob one of marshal mansion , he is forc to hide in the bedroom vault . there , through a two-way mirror , he see the wife and anoth man engag in passion foreplay . their game of love quick turn into a violent struggl as the man start beat the woman . in self defens , the woman grab a letter-open and stab the man in the elbow . she rais her arm to stab again when she is fatal shot by two secret servic men . the man ? he is the presid of the unit state of america . where doe the film go wrong ? it cannot be the act . clint eastwood , ed harri and gene hackman as the presid give type-cast , but decent perform . the cinematographi is suffici ; wild and errat dure action sequenc , dark and mysteri dure psycholog suspens scene , and calm and warm dure dramat dialogu . even the music is not as bombast as it usual tend to be in the thriller/suspens genr . the fault clear lie in the screenplay , and the screenplay alon . while set up a stori about misus of power , about the true possessor of that power , and about intrigu and double-cross , it doe not resolv it . not one buildup of suspens is resolv by an excit climax . rather , the tens situat are left dangl at the end , give the viewer an uneasi sens of incomplet . an exampl of this is a veri promis and tens buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the polic have set up a trap at a small restaur . polic offic are everywher , incognito of cours . at the same time , not one but two hit men are prepar to kill clint eastwood when he arriv . all three parti are unawar of each other presenc . this scene is tremend excit and the audienc is wonder how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult posit . he will probabl have a brilliant plan , involv ingeni prepar . howev , when he arriv at the trap , both hit men miss ( how conveni ) and in the confus eastwood simpli walk away . the buildup of this scene took about ten minut . ten minut of close up of the hit men load their weapon intercut with the polic prepar for the trap . the scene was resolv in less than 20 second . . . parallel to the stori line of catch the real killer is a clich emot tale about the estrang relationship between father eastwood and his daughter . the daughter blame her father for never be there for her , becaus he was either in jail or rob a hous somewher . of cours their relationship take a turn for the better dure the adventur and they end up a happi famili . again , it is commend that absolut power tri to deviat from the mainstream suspens film by give room for a dramat subplot . howev , tri is simpli not enough ! the second stori line should be subtl , origin and prefer unpredict . . . everyth this film is not . how could a screenplay like absolut power ever get the fund to be produc ? how could eastwood , who has success produc and direct mani outstand film such as the brilliant unforgiven , ever believ in a project like this one ? i am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/produc has diminish substanti due to this film . director quentin tarantino onc said : " i can make a good movi out of ani bad script . " director clint eastwood obvious cannot .
1 i think the first thing this review should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-file . first , let me assur you that no prior experi with the seri is requir to fulli enjoy this movi . the produc are not stupid , make a movi just for fan of the seri is not profit . you have to reach for a larger audienc . therefor , the movi is quit user-friend . altough , non-fan will onli fail to understand certain emot behind the look mani charact exchang . but fear not , duchovni and anoth man later on provid more than adequ background info on what is go on . you will never feel as if you just walk in on the third act of some great opera . in ani case , the answer is no . i am not a fan of the x-file , i onli watch it when noth els is on and i prefer millennium . howev , sinc the fox network as been so kind as to air sever key episod for sever week befor the movi open weekend i took that opportun to test the movi . i tape all of these episod and watch them onli after se the movi , i am glad to report that i learn noth new . everyth you need to know is explain to the viewer by duchovni and other . i know i am go mayb a bit too far to make my point but everybodi should get the chanc to experi this movi . warn : major spoiler follow ! pleas do not read to fulli enjoy this movi , you must not be abl know what is come , what exact is over that hill and what that weird " hummm " sound is all about . you have been warn . the x-file is what a summer should be . excit , scari , great special effect ( unlik other summer movi the effect do not take over the movi and are onli there when it is realli necessari ) and good perform . this is come from a guy who think david duchovni is the human equival of a wooden plank . from start to finish , this movi doe not let go of you . when i compar it with last summer movi the best way to describ it would be : take the excit and great score from face/off and the dead use of sound from event horizon . this flick is scari , not in a b movi kind of way where you alway know where and when the critter will jump at our hero . in fact , the first time the critter in this movi make an apper it is total out of the blue . you might as well bring ear plug becaus this thing is louuuudd ! the last time a monster scare me that much was when i first saw alien as a six year old kid . you know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor becaus the creatur might be under the chair , or when you keep tri to cover your throat with your shirt ? so yeah , the x-file is scari . and guess what ? you never even have to see the monster but your imagin work overtim and it sure beat have to watch a flaw , comput generat , babyzilla , it look like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undi type of monster . do not think that the x-file is a monster movi . in fact , the creatur is there for mayb three minut total . no , the x-file is defin a mulder episod of the seri . sculli is at his side , of cours , but gillian anderson get mayb half the screen time . she has a coupl of good scene with duchovni , but she get kidnap dure the last half hour of the movi so she doe not get to do much . no , this is mulder time in the spotlight . by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder " shower " independ day . if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let just say that due to recent event mulder should be " shower " godzilla instead . to those of you wonder if mulder discov that the truth is inde out there . . . who care ! ? if he did find it the seri would over anyway so what are you complain about ? the dialogu in interest and the director is marvel . the camera is almost alway look over the shoulder of our hero so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . the script is spotless , everi thing that happen happen for a purpos . if you are confus by someth , do not worri becaus it will all becom clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attent ! ! ! unlik most summer movi , the dialogu is twice as import as the effect . miss one vital piec of inform and , like most peopl who talk dure movi , you will go home and tell all your friend how this movi made no sens . also , to those peopl who need to go to the bathroom dure movi . . . don't ! the person who watch the movi with me had to go twice and twice she miss an import convers . there is no time to take a breather between scene becaus , again unlik most summer movi ( godzilla anybodi ? ) the x-file doe not need to fill scene between the suspens and the action with useless subplot , everi scene is crucial and serv a purpos . who need to see the blond chiouaoua have a " big emot scene " between godzilla attack ? so far this summer i have seen onli one movi who rank higher on my list of movi i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it onli win by a nose . but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movi , the x-file is . what more do you ask from a summer movi other than the chanc to be excit ? cool effect ? it got some . puls pound ? hell yes ! strang enough , i think that fan of the seri will hate this movi while non-fan will have a good time . it doe not provid answer to the show mani question , the status quo remain near the same and , no , mulder and sculli do not get togeth . rate : four and a half out of five star for the best movi yet this summer , sever jump right out of your seat thrill , mani " whoah , i never saw that one come ! " moment , four " holi shit , where the hell did that come from " and one heck of an end . you may wonder where this movi lost half a star . well , i swore never to give a movi the full five star so i had to find someth about the in his ice truck , the track it leav in the snow behind him go on for sever mile but then they just stop . it pretti obvious the film maker drove the truck for sever mile to give the appear that mulder had been drive for a long time , but in the end it look like mulder just drop from the sky and start drive .
0 has hollywood run out of interest charact and plot-driven suspens thriller that we must spend two hour watch will smith and a gritti gene hackman exchang obtus dialogu and run around dodg firebal ? in enemi of the state , that is exact right . a few part the net , and a few part conspiraci theori , enemi is about as excit as watch smith talk to cgi alien in 1997 lame brain men in black . will this guy ever get a real role ? he has the bruce willi syndrom . the plot is bascial smith , play a lawyer , get into hot water with some high govern murder , who assassin a power polit figur earlier in the movi , when a tape of the kill get into his hand . he inlist the help of an old conspir ( hackman ) , and , at the end , er . . . you know . enemi was one of the worst film of last year . not onli was it sloppi in tell it stori and get it fact straight , the act was mediocr when it should have been energi driven , and i didn't like how smith alway magic out-smart the badi when all the other extra charact , seem more intellig than smith , somehow got run over by a truck . enemi came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrect . i know these two film are differ in , well , everyth , but the fact that enemi outgross insurrect just baffel me . somehow , qualiti can't overshadow quantiti .
1 is it just me , or have disney film gradual lost their appeal ? i was almost stun by the qualiti of " who frame roger rabbit ? " , a fun , uniqu look at a world where cartoon and peopl live togeth . " the littl mermaid " harken back to , and perhap surpass , the classic disney anim from the first half of the centuri . howev , the endless stream of " the littl mermaid " wanna-b is get to me . you know the spiel : a lame plot recycl from some well-known stori , color , almost psychedel anim , the lead charact who learn a valuabl moral lesson , the comed sidekick/sidekick , the seem unattain love interest , a few catchi song , a few in-jok for adult , and the occasion out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke . it a formula , and like ani formula , it get tiresom . that whi i'm delight to hear that disney recent pick up the intern distribut right to the work of ghibli , a japanes cartoon studio . from what i'v seen of their movi ( " kiki deliveri servic " and the alreadi english-dub and american- distribut " my neighbor totoro " ) , foreign audienc are in for a treat . these movi , particular " kiki deliveri servic , " are wonder origin and entertain . " kiki deliveri servic " start with an unusu premis : kiki , upon hear forecast of clear sky , decid it is time for her to leav home . this is unusu becaus kiki isn't a colleg student or a young adult make her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her train as a witch . her mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatori age for such train , her parent treat her leav understand and put up onli token resist . just the idea of a witch heroin may scare away some audienc , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmless throughout the movi : kiki mother act as a villag doctor , and kiki is abl to do no more than fli on a broom . kiki must choos a citi to move to , and what she choos is the co-star of the movi : a german seaport town , far remov from the countri life she has been use to . initi lost in the imperson huge of her surround , she discourag , and unabl to support herself though her rudimentari skill as a witch . on the verg of leav for a new town , she use her power of flight to deliv a pacifi to a babi who drop it . the favor eventu blossom into her work as a courier , a one-person deliveri servic . this is where the movi becom shock good . kiki job is a catalyst for her realiz the beauti of the citi and the world around her . the townspeopl she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn't seem forc or artifici , but mere deriv from look at ordinari peopl in a differ light . they'r three- dimension , imposs to quick evalu , possess of fault , and understand reserv in kind toward a strang girl . howev , each one has someth about them , some interest or trait , that make them interest and uniqu . the person beauti of the citizen is compliment by the beauti of the surround : the seaport town genuin look impress , captur the european charm of a mediev citi adapt to the more modern need of the 1950 . this beauti is beauti with depth ; for everi detail left in , dozen are onli hint at . i could probabl go on all day , but i won't ; suffic it to say that mani of these minor detail could have been the highlight of the movi . some of my favorit are kiki relationship with the baker husband : although he quiet , never shown speak to kiki throughout the movi , and he initi scare her , his kind win her friendship . in the garag of a delivere hous can be found a vintag model t . two old ladi have a relationship evolv from master-serv to friend-friend . such detail give the impress that the beauti shown in the movi is onli the tip of the iceberg . ad on top of this is a lesson on the import of self-worth . kiki initi seem to deriv much of her self-worth from the beauti of her surround and the peopl around her , but an encount with a rude girl crash down her bewonder , make her question the import of such beauti . this caus kiki to lose faith in herself . howev , kiki come to realiz not onli the beauti of her surround , but the innat beauti insid her . see kiki regain faith in herself is marvel , and the princip devic use to do it is so sublim that i don't even want to hint at it . the end of the movi has a subtl charm combin with a sens of awe and , iron , the most disney-esqu moment i'v ever seen ; if you don't hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medic attent . the movi steer free of mani of the disney convent : there is no violenc , howev cartoonish , no song-and-d number , and kiki pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comed sidekick , although jiji is given mani funni line and scene . howev , i would be surpris if disney doesn't give jiji more joke , or at least the voic of some comedian . refresh enough , the moral lesson of the movi is not self-contradict , a habit disney movi have gotten into . " beauti and the beast " 's beauti bell , for instanc , learn that beauti was deriv from a person insid , and was then reward by have the beast turn into a handsom princ in snazzi cloth . kiki , on the other hand , learn to separ her wardrob from her self-imag , and noth more is made of her earli desir for better cloth than illustr her increas matur at the end of the film . anoth differ with disney movi is in the style of anim for " kiki deliveri servic " : not as color and dynam as disney anim can be , but with a greater attent to realism and detail , it fit the movi to a t . this is particular true with scene of kiki flight . the extrem realism of the bird in flight near kiki is magnific to behold , and help these scene captur the wonder of flight better than ani other film i'v ever seen . i'm not sure when or how this movi will be releas in the unit state . disney tentat plan a theater releas of " monoko hime " short follow the summer 97 japanes releas , and should start releas the other ghibli film after that . i'd guess that some will be releas on video and some will be theatric releas in peak season with no compet disney releas . although the wait is unfortun , it good to know that it be releas at all , for " kiki deliveri servic " is definit a movi worthi of widespread promot and releas . watch this movi . along with " man bite dog , " and perhap someth by woodi allen , this is the best movi i'v ever seen .

" inde . and ani filmmak with a three hour movi who end it with that gem of dialogu should expect to see it quot in a review . on a more posit note , let me add that sometim the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget it length . the mile in question ( green due to it fade lime-color linoleum ) lead from the prison cell to " old sparki , " the electr chair where execut were carri out at louisiana cold mountain penitentiari in 1935 . paul edgecomb ( tom hank , you'v got mail ) is the head guard of e-block , otherwis known as death row . keep his prison calm as they await the carri out of their sentenc is his primari respons . it is a respons which he capabl deleg to the other guard on his watch by insist they " talk to " the convict instead of yell at them . this practic lead to an unusu camaraderi between the guard and the men behind their bar . into his charg come one john coffey ( michael clark duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentl giant who has been convict of the rape and murder of two young girl . immedi , paul sens someth differ about this prison . perhap it the way he ask for a night light becaus he is frighten of the dark . or perhap it is the mystic heal power he demonstr as he " take back " paul bladder infect therebi restor him to health . base on steven king 1996 serial novel , the green mile doe offer other charact who have stori to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adam ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriend and train a mous to do circus trick ; perci wetmor ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadist guard sit on a transfer to a more lucrat posit becaus he has yet to see a prison " fri " up close ; and hal moor ( jame cromwel , babe : pig in the citi ) is the compassion warden for whom , despit all the execut he wit , death never loom as larg as when his own wife was diagnos with a tumor . while it is mr . hank " everyman " perform at the center of the film which give it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minut , it is the perform of his support cast that are most worth note . all involv do credibl work in their respect role , most especi mr . duncan , who turn in an impress , fulli realiz character . if onli the stori were more credibl . writer/director frank darabont ( the shawshank redempt ) has craft a flaw fantasy/allegori of sort ; one which is more spiritualist than spiritu , reli on a preternatur mystic rather than a genuin and god spiritu power . mr . darabont also overplay his hand consider in the manipul of our affect toward and associ with his charact . was it an accident omiss that the first two inmat who walk the green mile were be punish for crime never disclos ? by not know the reason for the condemn convict presenc on e-block , the audienc never get the sens of the justic which is be carri out , make the death penalti appear cruel and unwarr . this is especi true dure the gruesom depict of the second execut which was horribl botch . much has also been made of coffey christ-lik abil to heal but unlik the numer heal which are record in the scriptur , coffey power are shroud in mysteri , take on the feel of a circus trick , coupl with a voodoo-lik " i feel your pain " transfer . in contrast , there is no mysteri associ with the heal that is from god . the genuin " gift of heal " list in 1 corinthian 12 is just one of the nine manifest of holi spirit and can be oper by ani spiritu instruct man or woman in accord with the knowledg and wisdom of god . true spiritu heal ( with few except ) requir the commit believ of both the healer as well as the one be heal . such believ come not from the shroud secret of mystic , but from the reveal word of god .

( let pretend the loathsom and predict next stop wonderland never happen , shall we ? ) there are also some slow , repetit stretch as rubi and sam go over the same argument again and again over whether or not he crazi . the premis is strong enough to sustain interest , but it enough to throw a nod in the general direct of rod serl for wrap up his idea in half-hour time slot , commerci includ .
1 when peopl are talk about good old time , they actual want to make some bad time look better . nice exampl of such behaviour is contemporari attitud of popular media toward the 1970s . for new generat , superseventi are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv show and sexual freedom uncheck by aid . for peopl who actual had to live in that period , it was the gloomi decad , mark by lost ideal of 1968 , rampant inflat and unemploy , intern terror , fuel crisi and loss of faith in almost anyth that previous generat stood for . feel of despair and nihil found it reflect in mani film of that era . martin scorses taxi driver , which symbolis both the glori and despair of the seventi , is most celebr of them all . the movi protagonist is travi bickl ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marin who take the job of taxi driver in new york citi becaus he can't sleep at night . the job get him expos to the dark side of apocalypt megalopoli , and travi gradual get alien from the rest of world . the onli bright spot in his life is betsi ( cybil sheperd ) , attract woman work in senat palantin presidenti campaign . their date end as humili fiasco becaus travi make fatal mistak by invit her to porno movi theatr . lose his onli link to better side of the world , travi gradual descend into psychosi , becom convinc that his mission in life is to battl scum on the street . he purchas a formid arsenal of gun and begin physic prepar for the inevit conflict . that conflict final come when he take person interest in iri ( jodi foster ) , 12-year old prostitut who temporarili took refug in his taxi . as mani great movi that got cult status through the year , taxi driver becam the object of mani interpret . for some critic and scholar it is an explor of univers subject that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak realiti of dirti , overpopul industri citi ; the stori could have been set in 19th centuri same as in our time . for other , the movi use raskolnikov-lik figur in order to portray burn problem of 1970s america - it appar inabl to deal with the consequ of rapid social chang that occur in previous decad . brilliant perform of robert de niro in role of a lifetim can give argument for both side . his travi bickl has a lot in common with most of the averag viewer of today - mani of us share his feel of isol , loneli and outrag toward crime , drug , prostitut and senseless street violenc . his pathet attempt to establish some kind of human connect with the peopl around him , sometim in most unusu circumst - like with secret servic agent , pimp or job interview - make him a person too goofi to be the hero , and too pathet to be the classic villain . howev , most of the averag viewer are sensibl enough to recognis the tin line that separ concern citizen or troubl soul from fanat madmen . but despit anyth , averag viewer at the end actual cheer for travi - his crusad against " scum " is someth that averag person want , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brain to do it . while de niro travi might come in and out of particular time and place , other person that appear in the film ( most play by the charact actor ) give it distinct 1970s feel . wizzard ( play by peter boyl ) present the onli link with america better past ; but onli becaus he is the oldest taxi driver in compani and therefor everybodi assum that he " know stuff " . his obvious inadequaci in give advic to troubl travi illustr the inabl of pre-1960 generat to find answer to the problem of gloomi decad . other charact , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . matthew " sport " ( keitel , who befriend real-lif pimp in other to prepar for his role of a lifetim ) is dress like a hippi ; iri found excus for her escap to the world of drug and child prostitut in a ideolog of countercultur . porno movi , that should be the element of new time of sexual freedom , are too much even for suppos " liber " betsi . even the politician , like senat palantin , are lost in post-vietnam and post-waterg mess ; his broad and senseless " messag " that cover the lack of ani serious program can't fool even such idiot like travi . the past is gone , the present is bad , and even the futur seem bleak , and the feel of pessim can't be wash away even by iron happi end . travi and his world found themselv in a desper situat , and martin scorses use the best of his cinemat skill in order to spill the gloom of schrader screenplay into the silver screen . new york citi in the night is portray as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam come out of sewer give it surreal , almost stygian atmospher . anoth import element of the atmospher is score of great bernard herrman , whose effici use of jazz element give some melancholi that soften the brutal of motion pictur . one of the greatest ironi of taxi driver is the fact that the movi was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . instead of receiv cult status becaus of his artist merit , for mani year it was tabloid-fodd becaus of hinckley and his real-lif re-enact of event in the movi . now , more than two decad later , when some other " life imit art " incid get more attent , we can final enjoy taxi driver in all it artist glori .
1 there must be some unwritten rule that state , one get enlighten not in the way one expect to get enlighten but in the commit given to seek wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seem to be lead nowher . in the exot morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippi mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girl , the 6-year-old luci ( carri ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arriv for a year stay , with the self-absorb mother oblivi to how her daughter might be adjust to this foreign experi while she is search for a chang of life from her unfaith poet husband ( she is not offici marri to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of look for the etern truth in the sunni climat of marrakech . at least she say she is , as she is make some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answer . she has not plan thing out too care , have no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it much fun , more like a misadventur , with some romanc with a local moroccan thrown in . drug , a world-wid youth phenomena dure this period , where mani western came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheapli , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worri about be hassl by the local author , even though drug are illeg there . but this is not shown as one of her reason for be here . in this film , the subject of drug is never broach , onli hint at in an off-hand but slur way , as the hippi commune is shown in a negat light , strum on their guitar and brag about the hit of acid they have taken . even the one come here for spiritu reason , to follow the mystic sufi , seem lost follow a cultur that is far differ from where they were come from . the film is base on the novel that contain the autobiograph experi of sigmund freud grand-daught , esther freud , who travel here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . it is written by the director brother , who has previous direct regener , the playboy , and trojan eddi . the titl of the film come from the squeal giggl that say hideous kinki give the littl girl . with julia strap for cash and not receiv a need check her husband often forget to send her , she is prevent from see the greatest live sufi who is locat in algeria ; so instead , she meet an acrobat street perform in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . he becom her lover , take the place of her husband as a father figur for the girl . the girl readili accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their open sexual relationship , but the girl realli don't know what to make of the relationship . it especi bother bea , who is embarrass by her mother loos attitud and want to go home . thing go surpris sour when bilal take them to stay in his small villag . it seem onli that bilal charm is match by his shiftless , as he has a wife who still live there . this scene didn't make too much sens as to whi he would take them there know the situat , unless the uneduc man was total uneduc in the custom of his peopl , also . but i doubt that . the famili is now stuck without money in a backward area tri to decid what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who near kill them when he fall asleep by the wheel . luci take it all in stride and has a good disposit for travel , while bea just want to go to a school and learn someth and be a normal girl . the beauti of marrakech is match by the terrif perform of kate winslet , as the film accur encapsul the timeless citi and it bustl street scene , expans view , illustri mosqu , and grand sunset . kate enact the feel of what it was like to be a western , live out the countercultur experi while await to gather her sensibl again and was fortun enough to be abl to go home the better off for her experi , as mani a drop-out reluct had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpos . the background music from group like america and jefferson airplan , provid further nostalgia for this easi to look at and easi to grasp film . the onli hope was that the two innoc girl would not be perman harm while on this sojourn , a ventur that should be reserv onli for those of colleg age or older who choos to go there for themselv . the famili travel , which is on the edg , has julia wake up scream from dream that are bleak haunt ; but , when she get up , all there is , is this splendid empti all around her and a vacuous life that is start to bother her . that marrakech is disarm gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is start to wear thin in her thought . it will dawn on her , when bea take ill , as she reflect on what the sufi guru tell her , whom she final meet and is driven to tear in his presenc . he is the guru who replac the one she want to see but who die befor she got a chanc to see him . the new guru is ground in realiti , someth she is not ground in , and seem to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyon els , even comfort her , by tell her that her tear are memories- a gift from god . the film weak was the empti feel i got from watch the stori unfold in it risk free tenor ( she was there basic to be just escap from her situat ) and how unapp the love affair seem between bilal and julia . the storylin about a helpless singl parent , detract from the vibrant experi mani other of her same baby-boom generat had dure their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystic cultur of sufism , a teach that has a lot to offer it follow , contrari to the impress the film might give , seem to pass her by . her knowledg of that trip is onli surfac deep , at best . she perhap would have been better off not take the kid along , smoke some hashish , and have been less assur of herself but to have behav more like a hippi and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . after all , the mystic trip is the journey . the film strength is in how all the charact are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judg too harsh for their shortcom . bilal is unreli but is capabl of generos . the littl girl are precoci but they are lovabl . julia , the cornerston the film is built on , is a mother who care about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintent harm them . she was tri to escap from realiti and that by return to london , she has anoth chanc to see if she can find the key to this world or whatev world she is look for and should no longer have nightmar about where she at . this is a veri freudian way to look at thing , as this sudden realiz , that thing are not right put an an end to her eastern hippi odyssey , at least , for the time be . and , after all is said and done , who to say if the children are also not better off for surviv their experi , just like she probabl was !

0 director lui mandoki last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama " when a man love a woman , " but his luck has ultim run out with his latest pictur , " messag in a bottl , " which is the worst type of romanc , a movi that tug so relentless and violent at the heartstr that it miracul manag to dri out your eye rather than tear them up . everyth that occur can be telegraph way in advanc sinc this same type of stori has been done mani time before---and much better---so there an absenc of suspens , and the film ultim move at such a veri , veri deliber pace , as if it is tri to make great , " meaning " statement and plot develop , that it just becom a tedious bore to sit through . " messag in a bottl " begin with theresa osborn ( robin wright penn ) , a singl mother and research at the chicago tribun , whom find a bottl wash up on shore as she is jog one day . insid the bottl is an anonym love letter address to a mysteri woman name catherin , and theresa is so taken aback by it honesti and sweet that she show it around at her work and , to her object , find that her editor has place the letter in the newspap . soon , a heavi research is conduct to find out who wrote the letter base on the type of bottl and a ship logo on the top of the type messag , and after it is trace to a man name garrett blake , theresa find herself travel to the outer bank , a boat town in north carolina , to find out the specif of the messag . of cours , garrett turn out to be a handsom , rug man around theresa age and play by kevin costner . she is immedi charm by him , but hesit to unveil the truth of whi she is there , and find that catherin was garrett late wife who die a few year earlier . do you think you know where this is head ? most like you do , and i wouldn't call it give away anyth to say that by the pictur end , the movi has fallen into deep , artifici melodrama that i didn't buy for a second . if there are ani posit thing to say about " messag in a bottl , " it is that the perform by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett stubborn , but love father , are far abov par to be in such a wast , " shaggi dog " love stori , and that the cinematographi by caleb deschanel take great advantag of the beauti eastern coast , and paint chicago as an equal allur citi . meanwhil , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar film that he has made recent . it seem that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make anoth movi set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridicul , centerpiec set on a storm-swept sea . the other actor are all , sad , wast , includ illeana dougla , an underus actress who seem to alway get stuck with the " friend " role , here play penn confidant and co-work at the tribun . the first half of " messag in a bottl " play like a hum-drum , trite televis movi for the lifetim channel , as theresa spend a great deal of time " get to know " garrett , with dialogu that is not the least bit stimul or entertain . usual , i am the type of person to practic saliv over dialogue-laden sequenc sinc the film is no doubt tri to develop the charact and their relationship , but here it all rang with a resound fals sinc the dialogu felt " written , " and not as if peopl were realli " talk . " when the main charact of a film have veri littl of interest to say to each other , and are not particular interest themselv , you know immedi that you are in troubl . i swear that while watch " messag in a bottl , " i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in it entireti befor arriv at the theater ( heck , in actual i'm not even familiar to the novel this is base on , by nichola spark ) . alway one step ahead of the charact , the movi ran so close and tight to the constraint of the tried-and-tru hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seem to almost be in danger of tear . nobodi win prize for guess that garrett will eventu find out theresa secret , and that sever obstacl will come within their way of live happili ever after . this same exact problem occur in last year veri , veri similar ( watch this , and you will realiz just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicola cage romant drama , " citi of angel . " although theresa is deepli touch by the " heartfelt " letter that she find in the bottl , perhap the filmak might have been better off find a messag in a bottl of their own , prefer befor film began . it should have read , " memo to screenwrit : use you brain !

1 a cinemat version of one of john irv novel is alway caus for celebr even if , as in the case of " simon birch , " the treatment is mere " suggest by , " rather than strict base on , the book . suggest mean that irv , author of the acclaim " the world accord to garp , " sold the right to his novel " a prayer for owen meani " to the disney machin for $1 million , but wouldn't grant them permiss to use either the titl or ani of the charact name . that an odd decision--irv claim it to protect both himself and the novel--but it one that doesn't unduli harm the finish product . irv book are rich and complex work , full of intrigu , color charact . " a prayer for owen meani " is no except ; it tell the stori of an unusu boy--cal simon birch in the film version--who is uncommon small in statur and possess a high-pitch falsetto voic , " like strangl mice . " simon believ himself to be " god instrument , " place on this earth to somehow effect god plan . simon is play by ian michael smith , who suffer from a rare enzym disord known as morquio syndrom which , among other thing , prevent bone , ligament , and joint from develop normal . smith debilit diseas make him an obvious physic choic for " simon birch " ; howev , the produc unwis favor form over function--smith act abil are limit at best . anoth drawback is that in the book , simon condit is describ the way irv describ ani of his characters--in care , love detail . watch " simon birch , " howev , creat a differ feel altogeth ; the audienc is forc into a voyeurist relationship with the charact , sure someth irv would not have intend . simon himself tend to be too cute and irrit , a combin of smith rooki status as an actor and the precoci one-lin he forc to deliv , courtesi mark steven johnson , the film director and screenwrit . fortun , simon birch isn't the real star of the film that bear his name . simon is more of a catalyst , allow his co-star to shape the stori , and the actor who fill those role to turn in outstand support perform , save the film from an obsequi , manipul destini . first and foremost is joseph mazzello ( " jurass park " ) , who is noth less than remark as simon best friend , joe . mazzello turn in a wonder layer perform for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tear ; he is certain an emerg talent . ashley judd posit beam in her role as rebecca , joe singl mother , and oliv platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben . david strathairn and jan hook play the town reverend and sunday school teacher respect and their contribut uphold the high standard set by the other . there even a surpris yet effect uncredit cameo perform from . . . well , that would be tell . perhap " suggest by " the novel is the appropri way to go after all , sinc " simon birch " onli focus on one chapter , one year , of simon extraordinari life . the film also chang the book end to one that is more melodramat , yet necessari given simon lot . the flavor of irv origin novel remain , however--th passion , friendship , and insecur that come with a chang of season to the littl communiti of gravestown , main , and the engag oddbal , both big and small , who resid there .

" what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one product compani put out an anim featur about ant , anoth put one out about bug ? which is whi i was pleasant surpris by " edtv , " which turn out to be a fresh , insight , and often time hilari film about the folli of instant celebr . the write , by howard longtim collabor lowel ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credit for give the subject matter a fresh focus . in the hand of a less-experienc director , " edtv " could easili have had all the flavor of yesterday meatloaf . with their true tv cabl rate be threaten by the garden channel ( appar peopl would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcast compani is look for a novel concept to attract viewer . program director cynthia top ( ellen degener ) come up with the idea of put a nobodi on the air and broadcast his everi wake and sleep moment . the hook is to find a regular guy , someon normal that peopl can relat to . while scout possibl candid , cynthia camera crew discov ed pekurni and his pig brother ray ( woodi harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believ he has what it take for his fifteen plus minut of fame . but on watch the videotap , the show produc are more taken with ed than with ray . he cute , he say all the wrong thing , and he 100% usda hick . cynthia boss , play by rob reiner , give the show a week to deliv the good and it tough go in the earli stage . the most excit thing that happen is ed brush his teeth . " action shot ! " wag one of the product assist when a coupl of pop tart jump out of the toaster . you get the idea . but soon enough , things--nielsen-boost kind of things--start to happen to this unassum san francisco video store clerk and the true tv camera are right there to document it . ed privaci is no longer his own , his newfound fame start have a negat impact on his famili life , and what littl digniti he has left is trampl on by the media . who should ed go out with ? you can be sure the pollster have a list . not onli is the film exceed well cast , but it perform are consist excel . matthew mcconaughey provid the face , the bodi languag , and the lovabl texan accent to fill the shoe of america latest phenomenon . he and harrelson look like they realli could be brother . salli kirkland is noteworthi in a difficult role as ed mother , and martin landau is one of the film highlight as al , ed ail stepfath . jenna elfman ( from tv " dharma and greg " ) prove herself surpris worthi in the compani of kirkland and landau , although those alpin eyebrow of her get a littl distract . even degener and reiner are better than you'd expect . in 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brook made a zani littl film call " real life " in which a small-tim opportunist make a real-tim documentari about a typic american famili . the scene of ed famili sit around the dinner tabl feast on kentucki fri chicken and wax idiot play like a big-budget variant on that film , parallel it wick invent humor . as with most film by albert brook , " real life " was funni , but absurd . the funniest--and scariest--th about " edtv " is that it is absolut believ .
1 this is one of the most funni and entertain comedi of the year and it just happen to be anim . there are some great voic over commentari from hollywood most famous celebr , some fabul anim and a compel stori . this is the best we'v seen from disney sinc " beauti and the beast " ( 1996 ) . this film begin an unspecifi time follow the happily-ever-aft conclus to toy stori . in the aftermath of their earlier adventur , buzz ( voic of tim allen ) and woodi ( voic of tom hank ) are now fast friend and all the toy live in perfect harmoni , content with their " live " . one day , andi broke woodi arm off , while play with him . woodi is now offici discarg and worthless , left with his nightmar , where he lie in a trash can with the other discard . later andi mother decid to have a yard sale , and she collect a few old toy from her son room . sinc one of these discard is a member of the move toy gang , woodi goe to the rescu , leav the safeti of the hous for the uncertainti of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . although his mission is success , he is place in a serious predica when a toy collector name al ( voic of wayn knight ) spi woodi while hunt through the ware avail at the sale . the cowboy toy repres the final collect need to complet his collect of merchandis from the old tv seri , " woodi roundup . " if he can acquir woodi , al can ship everyth to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . so , after andi mother refus to sell the wooden cowboy , al steal him , and it up to the other toy , led by buzz , to go into the citi to save their friend . and so , buzz , rex ( voic of wallac shawn ) , hamm ( voic of john ratzenberg ) , mr . potatohead ( voic of don rickl ) , and slinki ( voic of jim varney ) , go out on a danger journey to rescu their friend , they find themselv confront thing like busi street and other buzz lightyear toy . there are car chase , gun fight and final the confront between buzz and his nemesi ( who , by the way , resembl darth vader ) . meanwhil , woodi learn that he was onc a tv celebr and has a famili - a cowgirl name jessi ( voic of joan cusack ) , a hors name bullsey , and a father figur call the prospector ( voic of kelsey grammar ) . they offer him anoth life , as a celebr -- a toy in a museum in japan . he is now forc to choos between be love intens by andi for a littl while ( befor he grow up ) and be forgotten , or be admir by children for generat . the problem is , if woodi escap from al clutch and return home , they will end up back in the lone dark of storag . a real effort is made in the technic depart . the anim is rich and color , with lot of wonder detail . the " cinematographi " is also extrem improv sinc toy stori ; there are a lot of complic swing , turn and close-up that realli make an impress . light and filter are use to creat a mood ( as in a surpris emot moment - jessi remembr of her day when she was a belov toy ) the film contain a lot of in-sid joke ( such as the one about videogam ) , and entertain parodi on " jurass park " and " star war " . the film end with the " fail take " , the kind of scene that we are use to see after comedi show on tv . these outtak are some of the funniest scene in the film . but what in the end make " toy stori 2 " a memor experi is not the joke , it multipl parodi or marvel anim . it is it heart and emot -- the stori about the mean of friendship , love and even life itself . it is not difficult to predict that " toy stori 2 " would be a huge econom success , but it artist achiev was unexpect . unexpect becaus the first film wasn't much more than a demonstr of special effect . but most it was unexpect becaus disney hasn't produc anyth spectacular in year and is constant surpass by compani such as dreamwork and warner brs . but here the director has chang the atmospher of the film , make it more access and interest for person older that 9 year . this is a big step-away from the ancient law of disney-anim . off cours , this is not " antz " , it is not as intellig ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiec , but i promis that you'll find it as funni and enjoy as i have . whether this is the best anim film of the year , i dare not say . my choic would probabl be " the iron giant " , but ( along side with " american pie " ) this is the comedi of the year . i almost lost my hope for disney , but " toy stori 2 " prove that disney hasn't lost their abil to entertain .
0 the origin babe get my vote as the best famili film sinc the princess bride , and it sequel has been get rave review from most internet critic , both siskel and ebert sight it more than a month ago as one of the year finest film . so , natur , when i enter the screen room that was to be show the movi and there was nari anoth viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzl . it is a rare thing for a children movi to be prais this high , so wouldn't you think that everi parent in the entir citi would be flock with their kid to see this suppos " magic " piec of work ? a tad bewild , but pleas to not have to worri about scream kid and other disrupt that common go along with famili film , i sat back for 97 minut and watch intent and with a veri open mind , have great expect for the film . look back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i enter the theater . believ me ; i want to like babe : pig in the citi . the plot seem interest enough ; after the event that took place in the origin , babe the sheep-pig has becom a legitim nation phenomenon . but after a fate encount with a water well , arthur hogget ( jame cromwel , who the movi could have use alot more of ) has been render bed-ridden for a number of week and the farm begin to go under financi . the onli solut that his wife ( magda szubanski , go from delight charm to downright annoy ) can come up with is to make an appear with their new celebr pet at a nation fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set asid for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donat if they just made their case known to the public ) . problem is , the fair is be held in the middl of the dread " citi " , a complet foreign place to both the pig and his companion . set the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnam citi and shack up with a sweet ladi who just happen to love to help anim , despit the law that you cannot keep them in hotel . it is here that we meet an array of eccentr charact , the most memor be the famili of chimp led by steven wright . here is where the film took a wrong turn . up until this point , i had be have a rather enjoy experi . the begin featur some smart write and funni situat involv the farm anim from the first one and even an inspir moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accus of smuggl drug . unfortun , the stori wear thin as we are introduc to a new set of anim that resid at the hotel , none of them be even one-tenth as interest as the charact from the previous babe . the main topic of discuss surround babe : pig in the citi is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturb for small children , and i believ it is . at one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowli start to drown . at other time , we are treat to surrealist flash-back to mrs . hogget full caviti search at the airport . in fact , the overal tone of the movi is rather bleak and depress . howev , that is , as they say , neither here nor there becaus kid will probabl not like the movi anyway . the anim charact and their plight were simpli not intrigu enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alon entertain a child . anoth problem i found with the film was it sudden chang of pace and tone near the end of the stori . if you'r go to make a darker and more sinist sequel , fine . it may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a nobl ambit . but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movi and all of a sudden have slapstick final with mrs . hogget swing from wall-to-wal of a ballroom in elast overal ? it just didn't feel right and was more pain to watch than it was funni or entertain , and the same goe for the rest of the movi .
1 imagin this . you'r given a sword and a shield and veri basic , minim train . a man you don't know tell you that this will be the last day that you will live . you are thrown into an arena with thousand of spectat want to see you die . you frantic monitor sever close door which , in second , will releas vicious enemi prepar to destroy you . you watch as the innoc friend you made in the last few day are murder in cold blood . if you are lucki enough to surviv this chao thrown at you , you know you'r go to have to do it all over again tomorrow . eventu know matter how strong or skill you are , you'r go to die . this is the life of a gladiat . you'll never have to be a gladiat and after see ridley scott power gladiat , you'll be thank for that . with his new film , scott has return cinema to the fascin age of the ancient roman empir . and like those preced it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiat has near everyth go for it - a strong lead actor , a wonder support cast , eye-catch special effect , and a great script . sinc the two aforement film came out befor the prime target viewer of gladiat ( teenag to thirty-year-old male ) were around , a whole new genr may just be reborn and revisit . >from a weak begin , the film start off extrem gloomi and inauspici . rome best general maximus ( russel crow ) , who has help the empir conquer near everywher they have attempt , is current ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) wage a war against germania . scott shoot the gori battl in an awkward style , similar to that of save privat ryan but much less effect . it blurri , in slow motion , and the sound is mute . as soon as this artist method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who . it a good thing scott stop this after the first twenti minut or els gladiat would have been tortur to watch . instead , the general swear he will get out after this battl . he want to go back to his famili and his crop , he want a quiet life . but , unexpect , he get anyth but that . the die emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harri ) , decid to have maximus appoint new emperor of rome onc he die . he ask maximus to restor the republ by give more power to the senat . all of this doe not go well for aurelius son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expect his father to name him the new emperor . jealous and upset , commodus kill his own father , name himself emperor , kill maximus wife and son , and attempt to kill maximus . but maximus is abl to escap his own death and vow to kill commodus and fulfil marcus aurelius wish . now a slave , the onli way he can win his own freedom and complet his goal is to becom a win gladiat , who eventu are releas for their success . a stori of betray and promis , gladiat is more than just a mindless action flick . you actual care about the charact , sometim even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determin to make rome one way as maximus is determin to make it the other way . phoenix play his charact brilliant . think of commodus as the perci wetmor ( of pant-wett the green mile ) of the roman empir - a whini , sleazi , " respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man " brat who hate when he not the center of attent . everi scene we see commodus , he either cri or he look like he has just been cri . phoenix has definit matur as an actor sinc to die for , and gladiat show he more than just river littl brother . crow is also excel as the film grisly-fac hero . maximus is one of the few charact in recent cinema who actual has emot . this guy actual act like a anyon in his situat would act , he no invinc superhero who onli blurt out one-lin , he ( believ it or not ) act like a human be ! the rest of the cast , includ richard harri , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and conni nielsen are also first rate . ridley scott , use outstand special effect , has brilliant recreat the roman coliseum , the loud of the roman mob , and the citi of rome in general . the visual are breathtak and volumin , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 . the costum is also wonder from the detail shield and armor to the exquisit dress of the upper-class politician . gladiat is anoth movi you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experi . along with u-571 , action fan should have plenti to see in theater this week and should expect much more excit to come this summer of 2000 .
1 one of the more unusu and suggest violent film ever made , " se7en " is just a few step away from brillianc . howev , those few step away are onli a few step from a level of evil and deprav that few peopl want to discuss . the film receiv mix review upon releas , but there an under sinist appeal and intrigu to this that mani critic perhap did not notic . at time it get preachi about the horror it seem to be critic , but the script and the ultim pay-off are excel . the shock conclus is just as unpredict as the end of most film are predict . this piec of work is 100% intens . it uncomfort to watch , yet compel . " i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . " the stori creep along slowli and deliber , craft by visionari director david fincher . he has experi in tantal his audienc with inform and vision , but not give away too much too soon . this is the guy who direct the omin " alien 3 " . " se7en " is even more omin becaus the threat is real . it human and , while the script take some artist licenc , the way in which the diabol killer work here is actual realist . that is , if a human be could be so intellig , patient , wealthi , and disillus . after the most bizarr open credit i'v ever seen ( refresh differ in edit style and music accompani ) , the initi charact develop take place . morgan freeman star as detect william somerset , a knowledg veteran who is readi to give up on his job and the sick of societi . brad pitt co-star as detect david mill , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnam citi and full of furi to catch the bad guy . these two fine actor give the film it human qualiti ( along with the appeal gwyneth paltrow , who play traci , mill wife ) . howev , none of them stand out abov the materi . no disrespect intend , but two other actor could have play these part and the film probabl would have been about the same . an iron note is that somerset has onli a week ( or 7 , that seven , day ) left on the forc to train his young proteg . the titl of the pictur also refer to the 7 dead sin , as chronicl by john milton in " paradis lost " --gluttoni , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envi , & wrath . incident , i wrote the sin in order of how each victim was found . it the last two sin that are the most intrigu and shock , but i won't give that away . as i said , this has a great end and no one should spoil it . anyway , the brilliant killer set out to make a statement to the world that these sin will no longer be toler and he make the " sinner " suffer for it . the two partner stumbl over the corps of a grotesqu obes man . they learn that he was murdered--forc to eat himself to death . the killer leav small clue at this and other murder and , of cours , somerset and mill are smart enough to stay with him all the way . if they didn't , it would be one short movi ! the deliber pace allow for craftsmanship of detail and stori . we see a lot of blood , but it not especi violent . the suggest of what happen is far more disgust than anyth actual shown--lik most of the violenc in " pulp fiction " . " se7en " is gori , graphic , and disturb , but all the gore is post-death . still , if you tend to get queasi , don't eat food dure this film . kevin spacey play john doe , the aveng angel who claim that he the messeng who will right the wrong with his teach . like mani crazi men , he has some fine idea , but some sick way of express himself . spacey doesn't appear until the final 30 minut and also doesn't receiv bill in the open credit . howev , it his appear that turn this film upsid down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomin . a great villain manag to make you either root for him or feel compel to listen to his rambl regardless of whether you agre with him or not . this charact is so well written that it hard to disagre when he say that what he is do will be rememb by everyon . no serial killer has ever been so creativ . " se7en " is blatant unsubtl with it messag about the horror of the world and it often a littl too depress . what it lack in those area , it make up for with believ dialogu , top-notch screenwrit , unexpect twist , and realist charact . the technic aspect of the film are unobtrus . fincher use light , music , and edit quit well , but his stori is alway the thrust of the film . fortun , we don't find out what happen to mill and somerset after the close credit ( which are run backward up the screen ! ) . it better to imagin what path they will follow . this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quick forget . it got a sinist messag and john doe is right about one thing--th evil of the world aren't go to cure themselv . " se7en " rais some tough question and it intellig enough to allow it audienc to answer mani of those question for themselv . useless trivia--co-star in 1995 " se7en " , brad pitt and kevin spacey also compet for the 1995 best support actor oscar--pitt in " 12 monkey " , spacey in " the usual suspect " ( for which he won ) .
0 in the continu of warner brother franchis , joel schumach has success kill this cash cow . what make this film such a grand disappoint is the tremend line up of talent peopl involv with the film . avika goldsman screenplay is such a clutter mess that there is no suspens built from one scene to anoth . this come on the heal of such a marvel written project as " the client " is such a shock that it give rise to thought that the latter film was a fluke . situat are develop and execut with no thought of reason other that to get the charact from one point to anoth . this is most glare brought to point by the appear of alicia silverston batgirl , who just happen to be alfr niec . the stori of dr . victor freez is told almost complet in dialogu as an afterthought . while work on a cure for a tragic deceas contract by his wife , dr . freez is injur dure a cryogen procedur , and becom a man who can onli surviv in a sub zero environ . now of cours he has becom a terrorist intent on turn the world into a frozen planet where onli he can live . now the logic of that littl sub-plot escap me . if mr . freez want to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , whi would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth . this is inde a cold heart man . the develop of poison ivi is no less contradictori . she want to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an anim . she join with mr . freez in his plan to start a new ice age , destroy all anim life , therefor give her plant creation no reason to have the defens mechan she had been tri to breed into them . the charact have no logic . batman of cours is no longer the dark knight of the earlier film . now that he has an adopt son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayn is tri to be a father figur , constant spout out homili about famili and relationship , while at the same time not realli have ani . georg clooney tri in vain to keep from roll his eye while recit the dialogu given him . to say that his perform is workman-lik is to be generous . his best perform are still on " e . r . " . bruce wayn has the most unromant even with his girlfriend ( play by ell macpherson ) , that it bring into question bruce latent homosexu . there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicol kidman psychologist in " batman forev " ) between bruce and anyon other than alfr . and even that relationship is veri reserv . robin come off less charismat that in the last film in the seri . now he just a spoil kid . in " batman forev " , burt ward want to be batman partner and friend . now , robin is suffer from ego defici . robin attract for poison ivi is not believ , except for a boy around the age of 15 . his later flirtat with batgirl smack of incest , even though they are not relat in a tradit sens . chris o'donnel , onc consid a rise star , success burn up on reentri with this perform . his robin need noth more than a good spank . the less said about alicia silverston perform the better . this talent young actress read her line with all the aplomb of a dub actor for a godzilla film . she was cast strict for her commerci valu and she knew it . this bring us to the villain . arnold scharzenegg walk through his part with all the concern of someon wait for payday . the most redicul scene is dure mr . freez imprison . the guard are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbeliev fight scene caught on film . it almost as ludicr as see michael jackson as a gang member . umu thurman strut and coo her way through her part , show a grow discomfort with her sex symbol status . her poison ivi has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in " sextett " ( 1978 ) . the onli perform worthi of notic are pat hingl and michael gough . these two season veteran carri their scene with a digniti sore lack from the rest of the film . without go through the intricaci of the plot , there is one question that alway come to mind with this seri ( except for the first " batman " ) , and that is how do these super villain manag to hire so mani thug onli to abandon them at the final reel . mr . freez is introduc with a team of hockey play hoodlum that seem to have step out of an old kiss music video . everi villain ( even the minor one ) have to have a look , no one can be an individu with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elabor costum . with this film , warner brother has succeed in retrograd the seri back to it tv incarn . the onli thing miss from the action scene are the superimpos titl detail the pow ! , gwaaaa , and clang associ with the old seri . you almost wonder if william dozier , produc of the tv seri is collect royalti from this film . the special effect ( by john dykstra ) and product design ( by barbara ling ) are the primari star of this film . and it is a case of extravag in the pursuit of noth . everi set , from ivi lair , the batcav , to freez hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for year to come . there is no one realist set or set piec in the film . everyth is set for maximum exposur . the special effect have that strang cartoon look that most rush cgi effect have . there are homag thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on " the time machin " ( the grow plant scene ) but these scene are so wroth with glare color and art that they are almost obscur . joel schumach has direct the film with no flair . camera angl are poor chosen rehash set up from the old tv seri . master shot pepper the action scene , destroy ani flow of kinet qualiti they may have had . mr . schumach is a good director . one just has to look back on the film " the lost boy " , " cousin " ( an underr film ) and " the client " to know that . but " batman and robin " come off as a mate made for tv movi . the film has no style of individu . it is the cinemat equival to jell-o , pretti to look at , but empti . it is unfortun that this film , even with it surpris strong box offic has succeed in do what warner thought tim burton would do with the franchis . kill it . joel schumach " batman & robin " is loud , color , action pack , and ultim . . bore . star .
0 >from writer and director darren stein come jawbreak , the poor told tale of what can happen when an innoc birthday prank goe wrong . at reagan high , four girl are sit on top of the world . courtney shane , play by rose mcgowan , hold the titl of meanest , most disrespect soul in the school . everyon hate her , but everyon envi her due to her popular . courtney is the " leader " of her cliqu , which also includ juli , play by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , play by charlott roldan , and marci , play by juli benz are the other three in the group . it is liz seventeenth birthday , and juli , courtney , and marci concur that they will play a seem innoc prank on her , but the prank result in the death of liz . just like stupid teen in ani teen direct film such as this one , the foursom decid to cover up the death to make it look like a murder commit by someon els . and also just like in other teen direct movi , one of the four don't agre with hide it , this time that charact be juli . and final , just like in other teen movi , there is a wit outsid the group tri to hide the truth . this time that charact be fern mayo ( judi greer ) , who is subject to mani crack from courtney group , as well as the entir school . >from here , jawbreak turn into a predict tale of reveng , bad moral , and at least tri to do the right thing . not onli is the script weak , on a whole the act is horrid thank to a larg amount of the main cast . judi greer is undeni aw as her one dimension , annoy charact , as she overact everi line she has . also on the bad side of act is juli benz , almost fall to the annoy factor that greer deliv . on the posit side of act , rose mcgowan perform well here , but doesn't match her wick clever perform as " tatum " , in 1996 scream . mcgowan role is annoy , but this onli add to the film . she is wick mean , and even though she a well-written charact , you downright hate her . fare even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is alway except believ as her role . when the script feed her a one or two dimension charact , she turn it into three , alway put strong emot and power into her role . gayheart isn't given as much to do here as she was in 1998 urban legend , but you can still get a strong tast of her act skill in jawbreak . jawbreak drift and miander differ sub plot throughout , hard throw anyth for the viewer to get absorb in . we get way off of the topic of the jawbreak incid , and get into thing that don't have anyth to do with the actual film . the begin and end are strong , it just the middl that need a lot of help . dure the bodi of the movi , it is undeni repetit , never progress toward a conclus . noth to grab the viewer interest is around , and the same , extrem annoy song play over and over again . jawbreak tri to get off on the same time of humor use in the 1995 film clueless , but fall flat . the few gag that actual work die off quick and die off with a bang . all in all , a horribl disappoint . the bottom line : the taglin read , " even the sweetest candi are sour as death insid .

1 the question isn't whi has greas been reissu . the answer to that one is easi : to celebr the movi 20th anniversari and to make more buck for paramount coffer becaus john travolta is onc again a hot commod . no , the question that ought to be ask is : should greas be reissu ? the answer is not an easi one . greas is a fun movi , an entertain fantasi of the 50s , embodi all the clich of that era . the music is live and the danc number , choreograph by patricia birch , are energet and high-spirit . travolta was at his pinnacl as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threaten . but greas didn't break ani new cinemat ground . it was not a mileston in movi histori such as citizen kane or easi rider . what greas is - or has becom - is the highest-gross music in film histori . ok , let not be a spoilsport . greas is a fun and entertain movi , even though it stretch credul to see such perform as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi jeff conaway and the multi-tal stockard chan tri to act like high schooler . it nostalg to recal how good a dancer travolta was , and it sad to think of what could have been had not a few misstep sidetrack his career . he could have becom a music comedi star in the tradit of gene kelli . cinemat , the music comedi has basic gone the way of the dinosaur . between greas and 1996 evita . , you can probabl count the number of movi music on one hand . two reason have contribut to the demis of the genr : the first is that movi audienc have becom more sophist , no , make that cynic and jade . today , if a charact began to danc and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probabl be hoot off the screen . today audienc lack the innoc , that belief in movi magic that is requir for a music to succeed . second , a lack of talent . perform with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-lif panach of fred astair , gene kelli , ginger roger and judi garland are gone . most singer and dancer remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movi usual wind up in serious dramat part . a good exampl is gregori hine , one of the greatest dancer in the world . he danc a bit in the cotton club , tap and white night , but those were essenti dramat vehicl . so , perhap the reissu of greas can serv a purpos . if audienc show enough interest , mean if the re-releas earn the studio enough revenu , it may spark a reviv in movi music . perhap not origin music such as singin in the rain , an american in pari or seven bride for seven brother , but for broadway properti that have been in the plan stage for film adapt for sever year . at one time or anoth , accord to the industri rumor mill , hollywood has been set to creat an anim version of andrew lloyd webber cat , a film of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miser and chicago , the latter report to star madonna . so , let this greas be the forerunn of an armada of movi music . let greas be the word that spark this reviv .

1 wong kar-wei " fallen angel " is , on a pure viscer level , one of the most excit film i'v seen in a long while . unfortun , wong seem more interest in experi with his camera than creat tangibl charact for the audienc to root for . ordinarili , that alon would be enough to sink a movi , but in the case of " fallen angel " , this is not so . everi shot in this film is excit just to * look * at . wong doe realli interest thing with the camera , but he doesn't allow the pyrotechn to complet take over , as was the case with last year dismal " knock off " ( which contain a shot of a foot enter a shoe . ugh . ) the movi follow three pair of lost soul as they struggl to find some mean in their live . i can't say much more than that as i didn't realli know what was go on most of the time . in fact , it wasn't until about halfway through the movi that i was abl to distinguish between each charact . the constant move camera doesn't realli allow for the audienc to associ with ani one charact . we'r alway kept at a distanc from these peopl , i suppos in order to further add to the feel of alien felt by the charact . " fallen angel " is a refresh change-of-pac from most hollywood film , which never bother to tri anyth differ , at least on a visual level . in fact , i'd go so far as to say that " fallen angel " is more challeng visual than ani mainstream hollywood film i'v ever seen . sure , there director like robert rodriguez who enjoy turn violenc into operat orgi of death , but to see a filmmak like wong who actual assault the sens with imag is truli someth worth celebr . but if wong wish to becom a legendari filmmak , he need to work on incorpor an actual stori into those awesom imag . there were far too mani instanc dure " fallen angel " in which i ask myself , " now who are these peopl again ? is this that first coupl or the second coupl ? " it was imposs to keep track . perhap he could let the audienc know right away which charact is which , by introduc them to us with " name card " , as in scorses " mean street " . that realli besid the point , though . wong kar-wei has proven himself , through veri few film , that he a movie-mak to watch . let just hope that he hone his storytel skill with his next few movi .
1 everi onc in a while , a film sneak up on me and take me complet by surpris . i don't necessarili mean in term of qualiti ; rather , i'm refer to the mere knowledg of it exist . usual i know what film are on the way a year in advanc , but two week ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . it has slip rather quiet into limit releas , and appear destin to slip out just as quiet . that a shame , becaus princess caraboo is a delight fabl , romant , gentl and veri appeal . what more , it surpris insight and provid a sharp-wit lesson in english social histori . princess caraboo is base on an actual event in earli 19th centuri england , involv a young woman ( phoeb cate ) who is found wander the countrysid . appar unabl to speak ani english , she is taken in by good-heart gentlewoman mrs . worral ( wendi hugh ) . her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleas about this strang houseguest , until the worral begin to believ that the woman may be royalti from an east indian island , the princess caraboo . this develop inspir plan for a lucrat trade ventur for mr . worral , and an introduct into elit social circl for mrs . worral . howev , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinc that the woman is what she seem to be , and set out to find out the truth about princess caraboo . as a social satir and comedi of manner , princess caraboo is a winner . it take place in an era when it was common practic in england to jail vagrant and hang beggar , and that practic come in for an obvious haze . but it is handl most effect through the charact of mr . worral , a drunken woman whose bank is in deep troubl thank to his corrupt and ineptitud . he is wors than one of the idl rich ; he is one of the activ odious gentri so eager to distanc themselv from the lower class they think noth of simpli elimin them , and sinc the hous and money are all from mrs . worral , he is a bit too close to them for comfort . while hypocrisi is an easi target for ridicul , director and co-writ michael austin keep the treatment too light-heart to be heavy-hand . he also take a uniqu stab at the trendi of the upper class , as the princess becom a " sensat " at court . in one of the film best sequenc , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a parti host by the princ regent ( a wonder foppish turn by comic john session ) , and the lord and ladi end up follow her around in a thorough silli nativ danc . it is then that princess caraboo show how easili peopl are swept up in " sensat , " an idea that take on a timeless qualiti ( and make the film an interest companion piec to the current quiz show ) . social commentari asid , princess caraboo is simpli an emin enjoy entertain . the perform are most delight , particular phoeb cate , who is radiant in a part that requir a gift for pantomim . her support player are also appeal : wendi hugh as the patient and kind mrs . worral ; kevin kline as frixo , the worral suspici and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weari but ultim romant gutch . onli john lithgow is a disappoint , turn in a limp perform as a scholar who attempt to verifi the princess ident . the stori twist and turn just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is realli a princess is alway in some doubt , without becom gimmicki . it is unfortun that the grow attract between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , becaus the potenti seem to be there . when it final doe blossom , it seem too quick to be plausibl . princess caraboo is patient enough in establish it sens of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewer seek a fantasi romp . still , it has both escapist and intellectu appeal , and is well worth seek out . it is the kind of film that make my job it most rewarding--a hidden gem .
0 what a contrast ! in the space of two day , i saw shakespear in love and hurlybur . i'm not sure you could get two more differ movi . while the former was all over the top , telegraph everyth , shove it philosophi of life down our throat , hurlybur was the complet opposit , wound so tight and with so much buri in it script , one could spend week think about it . this is one interest movi . it veri much in a similar vein to one of my favourit movi of 98 , in the compani of men , although not quit so nasti . there lot of talk and some scari insight into the world of men . hurlybur doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddi ( sean penn ) around as he tri to make sens of his life and the peopl around him . his big question is : doe it all pertain to him ? and if it doe , how is he suppos to feel about it all ? " it " mean everyth : televis , friend , event that happen . i guess it could be sum up more crude as : what it all about ? this is not a movi for answer . donna ( anna paquin ) give some but they'r not realli satisfi : they just lead to more question . that what make this movi stay on your mind . these are the sort of question that occupi our time . even when we push them to the background , howev we resolv these question influenc everyth we do . the perform are all superb in hurlybur . i haven't seen sean penn in much befor ( in fact , i can't rememb see him in anyth ) , but he is brilliant in this . eddi isn't a likeabl charact , but sean penn make him understand . i don't want to be his friend but i'd like to help him . chazz palminteri is also great as phil , make him an aw person . i'd never want to know phil but still i understand whi eddi want to be his friend . everyon in this film nail their perform , make this world real . it a nasti world ; it a sexist world . unlik shakespear in love which is unfail polit correct , hurlybur is a man world , seen unapologet through the eye of men . i find this fascin and on two count , depress . first , it depress that such a world exist . a larg part of hurlybur success is that it convinc me that such peopl are real and that this sort of environ exist everi day in hollywood ; that there are a larg number of men out there who believ women to be complet peripher to their world , toy , playth . sure , everyon is background to everyon els but in this world , women are a long way in the background . second , these are the movi that are be made : stori about men world . where are the stori about women world ? not the soap opera and the " chick flick " that are meant to satisfi women , but the real stori that touch on the essenc of life like hurlybur doe for men . hurlybur is base on a stage play and that is evid from the moment the film start . it veri talkat , intellig and static . while this can make the film drag a bit , and peopl sometim sound like they'r quot textbook , most this is a good thing . not all film have to be fill with special effect and sweep panorama . not all film have to underestim the intellig of their audienc . all it mean is that hurlybur is probabl just as effect on video as it is on the larg screen . it also mean that you have to pay attent .
1 lisa cholodenko " high art , " is an intellig , quiet drama . it strongest qualiti , asid from the top-notch central perform , is the percept way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observ it charact . they are all flaw peopl , some more troubl than other , but they are not judg . judg the charact in this pictur would be a creativ misstep on the filmmak part , becaus no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserv to be negat judg if they are involv in some serious problem that they cannot break free of . syd ( radha mitchel ) , a 24-year-old woman live with her longtim boyfriend jame ( gabriel mann ) , has recent been award an ideal job at the high-profil photographi magazin , " frame .

" high art , " is such an effect motion pictur becaus it is never suger-co or ideal , but instead an honest and convinc portrait of a hand of unhappi peopl whose live are go nowher , while syd luck begin to rise . the film in no way is about lesbian , but about love , which was a refresh chang of pace from the usual stereotyp portrait of homosexu . as luci and syd grow closer and closer togeth , we realli do believ that they are fall in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doom . with this pictur , alli sheedi star has risen onc again , thank to her touch , near flawless portrtay of luci , a woman who , in the cours of a decad , has found her life consum almost entir by drug , which has taken away her once-blossom career . her charact realli is tragic , and one particular scene involv luci and her mother , in which luci admit to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter-of-fact respond by say she can't help her , is heartbreak . although not autobiograph , sheedi has had drug problem in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledg of alreadi be in luci footstep to her role . also veri good is radha mitchel as syd , who previous star in the slight 1997 australian comedi , " love and other catastroph , " wh caught me by surpris with her perform . easili be abl to pass as christina ricci older sister , mitchel obtain the same natur charisma that has made ricci so popular recent . as accur as almost everi detail is in , " high art , " i wish the relationship had been more tight written involv syd and jame , who , play by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role . by the time he find out about syd and luci , he disappear from the film , and i wish there had been anoth scene where they confront each other . this is a veri minor fault , howev , in a film that is full of rich . although mani of the charact are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair , syd and luci are intellig peopl who recogn their problem . the charact of dominiqu ( anh duong ) , the " frame " editor who decid to give syd a chanc with her idea , was also written to be far more matur than expect . and the one sex scene in the film was beauti and origin done . for onc , it did not invlov steami , or violent sexual activ , or gratuit nuditi , but focus on the actual charact , who love each other , and their insecur involv in make the decis to actual have sex . " high art , " which won the screenwrit award at the 1998 sundanc film festiv , mark the superior featur film debut of cholodenko , as well as sheedi strongest , and best , role to date .
0 a suav , cool , collect , rich , uptight bad guy = clich . a clumsi crimin oaf to add to the laugh = clich . a bad guy who own a wild anim = clich . a crook , chauvinist law enforc type = clich . at an intens moment , our main charact tri to get away , but the car has troubl start = clich . complain about clich = clich . ok , ok . so we alway hear about clich . but if there was ever to be a prime exampl , the real mccoy is it ! not one utter word , not one frame of film , not one charact in this whole movi isn't a cut and past exampl of everyth we'v ever seen . they might as well use this as a train film : " how to make a bank robberi film in the 90 " . karen mccoy ( kim basing ) is a bank robber who just got out on parol after a six-year stay at the state prison . she want to make thing right and go straight , especi with the fact that she has a six-year old son out there who doesn't even know she aliv . awar of mccoy bank rob expertis , snivel bad guy jack schmidt ( terenc stamp ) use the same six-year old to coerc mccoy into return to her past . he want mccoy to pull off an elabor heist of 18+ million dollar at the same bank she got caught tri to rob six year earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt . and if she refus ? who know what he'll do to the kid . ( cue sinist laughter ) this movi is so pathet piti that it hard to know where to begin . the aforement clich are brutal abund . i can't stress enough how everi singl element , whether it be a charact , the dialogu , a plot " twist " , etc . , is so damn generic that you'll wonder if * anyon * is work behind the scene , let alon in front of the camera . basing is absolut vacant . and where do they get off tri to make us emot attach to her ? here someon that spent their time rob bank , and now as she head onto the street , we'r suppos to feel sorri for her . as she confront her son , who doesn't even know who she is , are we suppos to break into tear ? ? especi when neither basing nor zach english , who play the kid , has ani depth or emotional-radi whatsoev . i suppos i should mention val kilmer . yeah , that right - he in it ! quit sad too , see as how i can discuss everyth about the movi and never mention his name . and he got second bill ! to be fair , i will admit that kilmer had potenti in his role as the bumbl crimin wannab j . t . barker . unfortun the script doesn't allow much room for improv , and when his charact is use like bookend ( he never show up in the middl of the film ! ) , we have no time to appreci what he might have brought to this project . the real mccoy just can't keep it head abov water , and soon , * veri * soon , sink into a clich mess of movi . the actor are like dummi be move about by an unenthusiast puppet , and the dialogu , particular schmidt trite dialogu , fall like the niagra . this is definit one to avoid , folk . the real mccoy is anyth but !
1 it tough to realli say someth nice about a type of person who so ethnocentr that ani human they onc had is now gone , but by god , " american histori x " doe it , and for that , i commend it . it not onli take ball but intellig to make a human be out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedic their live to hate anyon who not what they are , and this film wise and miracur pull it off . the subject of this film is one of them , but he is wors than one of the blind follow that make up most skinhead member sinc he is the leader of the pack . he the one who instig them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in anoth brilliant stroke , justifi it with polit propoganda that make eeri sens when he speak . he so utter convinc as a public speaker and so firm in his convict that it come as a shock when he actual goe through the rehabilit process . his name is derek vinyard , and he play by edward norton with so much fire and intens that when he speak he almost as convinc and arrest a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboid on his left breast , a devlish goate , and he attack the black carjack outsid of his hous dress in noth but his white boxer and carri a handgun in his hand that never seem to run out of bullet , at least when he doesn't need them . he so believ in his convict that he will to put his belief to the test , even if he know it will mean a stop in prison , if onli for a coupl year . " american histori x " is about derek , how he becam a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilit in prison after murder two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the steal of his car and more to do with prove himself , and how he tri to save other , name his younger brother , from make the same mistak . we see him at all of these stage - as a smart teenag , a vicious hate monger , a man have an epiphani , and the man who tri to correct what he done befor - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all side . or at least , that the intent . the film frame devic is his brother , danni ( edward furlong , perpetu look about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his princip , bob sweeney ( averi brook , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek deep space 9 ) , is tri to " correct " him . when the film open , danni has just written a book report on " mein kampf , " land him in troubl with sweeney , which caus him to make him write a paper on derek life and how it has gotten him nowher . coincident , this day is the day derek is releas from prison , and when we see him , he cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . he just as intellig , but still veri rough along the edg , but he wisen up . he no longer control by his anger at black and jew , and tri to persuad danni , who becom what derek was befor , to give up his lifestyl . but danni won't . he goe to a larg skinhead beer bash , meet with the skinhead leader ( staci keach ) , and then discov that derek is as oppos to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a coupl of year ago . the film circl around this , then spin off into non-linear flashback , all done in black and white . we most see derek at his prime as a skinhead , live in venic beach , organ vicious and quasi-sadist raid on local store that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenag sinc they can easili get cheaper illeg immigr to do the same work , and mouth off his theori on affirm action and how illeg immigr and black have destroy the fundament this countri was built on . to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzi end of the lolipop , and he not onli speak elloqu , forc , and intellig , but he back everyth up with polit reason , justifi their rage at least to them . and frighten enough , much of what he say sound true . " american histori x " is a collect of realli great scene and moment , rather than a cohes , great film that flow effortless from one moment to the next . in it , there are some of the best scene i'v seen all year . one scene featur a dinner between derek famili , and his mother newest boyfriend ( play with reserv by eliott gould ) , a jewish liber who quiet disagre with derek rightist view , launch the scene into a fit of rage and anger that build unparal emot in the audienc ( gould reaction to derek final summat is unnerrv ) . anoth scene use humor and tradit macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connect between derek and a black co-work ( guy torri ) while fold laundri in prison . and anoth soon-to-be-class is actual divid in two : the murder of the two black men that wind derek in jail , which contain a final murder so nasti that it may be the most revolt shock all year . there much more to appreci , like the act , which is uniform good , with stand-out come from averi brook , bever d'angelo ( as the long-suff mother ) , and gould ( who has one horribl line , but other than that , come off with the best perform he given in what seem like a realli long time ) . norton walk off with the film , though , come off with such intens that he reduc anyon not do an adequ job to rubbl . in onli the fifth movi of his career , norton has invent himself as one of the most reliabl and intens actor of his generat , and mayb the best . there noth like it when norton realli get roll in this movi , spew out line with such author that he command all attent from the audienc , come off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . that he allow the littl emot to seep through is amaz . sad enough , this isn't go to be the great portrait of racism that it perhap hope to be . it too unambiti and even a littl contriv to realli take off as either a power statement or an emot masterpiec . the end , especi , is pencil in from other movi , toss in just so the emot keyboard can be trounc upon . some of the skinhead are reduc to mere clich ( kevin smith regular ethan suple fair rather annoy as the " fat skinhead , " whose line consist without fail of express his desir to eat more ) , and even the dramat arc isn't as well travel . furlong danni never seem to realli be learn a lesson , sinc the flashback refus to show his point of view , and when he decid to make a chang by the end ( which was inevit ) , it doesn't seem like it has actual arriv there . even derek descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justifi . though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from " boy meet world , " and don't ask me how i know that ) is kill by a black junki , and even befor he spoke against affirm action intellig , there never seem to be ani real back stori whi derek becam so intens about his belief . as such , one can see whi the director , toni kay , want to have his name remov . sorta . " american histori x " is a veri good movi , and i was veri move by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seem to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claim to be his potenti . somewher , he claim , there lie a toni kay cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was view by norton , who then order anoth cut , and that is thus . although he aim for the direct credit to go to " alan smithe , " the resid name for ani film that is to be disown by it director , it wasn't allow to him , under the ground that onc you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but realli , that the macguffin - no one realli want a film this good to be given the alan smithe sign of disapprov ) . kay right in that it not up to par , even if he not refer to normal par but rather his own person par . this will not be a " do the right thing " for the late 90s . yet it still get it point across intellig , and back it up with it stori ( it messag , that one cannot be so enwrap in one own belief or pain and suffer will occur , is liter said over the narrat , unfortun ) . and even if it isn't perfect , at least when averi brook turn to norton after he has been beaten and rape in prison , and ask him if anyth he done has made his life ani better , it reali hit a nerv , not onli in derek , but also in the audienc .
0 there were four movi that earn jami lee curti the titl of " scream queen " in the earli 80s . two of them were halloween movi , but the other two -- prom night and terror train -- were the uninspir knockoff that came direct after the success of halloween . the same " god , i'm scare , there some guy in a mask come after me " routin she did in john carpent classic , jami lee copi here , with none of the urgenc or suspens . terror train take place on ( where els ? ) a train , chart by some pre-m student finish their first four year of higher educ . most of them won't make it to med school , though , and it obvious from the foreshadow done when the conductor complain , " i wish to hell they'd put a radio on that train . " the conductor charact probabl has the most line of anyon , even jami lee . from the begin , he talk his head off ( he tell one of his co-work " think on this -- when the last time someon built a shop mall next to a train station ? " as if it make ani kind of sens ) and it onli get better as he engag himself in an argument about the benefit of railroad over recreat vehicl . of cours , the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloodi bodi , which is then gone when he bring a skeptic trainman back to view it . i forgot to mention the prologu . it a parti three year earlier , with the same group of student . two of them play a trick on a geeki frat pledg , promis him he go to get laid . they send jami lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he come in , notic a form on the bed . she say , " kiss me , kenni , " and he kiss the bodi on the bed , which happen to be a cadav . ( " oh my god , they kill kenni ! you bastard ! " ) it a sick trick , and one jami lee wasn't let in on . she still hasn't forgiven the guy as they board the terror train ( " you asshol , you can't have a good time without hurt somebodi ! " ) . the kill start befor the train even leav the station . sinc it new year , everyon wear disguis ( a conveni plot devic we'v seen befor ) , and someon stab the guy in the groucho mask when no one look . at least one of the charact say it a groucho mask ; when the killer don it and step aboard , it look like gene shalit who , by the way , would make a great killer in a slasher movi . speak of weird-look dork who still persist on the entertain scene , one of terror train most famous gimmick is the appear of david copperfield " as the magician , " who regail those aboard with illus set to disco music . then there his greatest trick -- get laid with hair that look like that . for all it attempt at visual style and substanc , terror train is more lionel than amtrak , more prom night than halloween , and noth realli worth watch . onli die-hard fan of jami lee curti and david copperfield ( if he truli has ani fan ) should even attempt to watch it . and it make me wonder if a horror movi set in an rv could be much wors . i mean , when was the last time someon built a shop mall next to a train station , anyway ? terror train is definit the cinemat equival of a sleeper car .

0 write a screenplay for a thriller is hard . harder than pour concret under the texa sun . harder than build a bridg over troubl water . and incident , a whole heck of a lot harder than write a movi review . thriller are all variat on a theme . you have a smart , resourc , and power bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet . you have a nobl and brave good guy , who has to protect the innoc , kill the bad guy , and not get kill himself in the process . the trick of thriller write is do all of this in an interest and novel manner . this simpl formula can lead to classic movi like north by northwest , high noon , or silenc of the lamb , or big summer blockbust like men in black , the fugit , or air forc one , or it can lead to utter dreck like mastermind , event horizon , kull the conqueror . . . . is anyon els get depress here ? point is , it not enough to follow the formula . you'v got to throw in someth extra , someth good and new and better than the last version . someth to surpris and move all of us peopl who buy the ticket and the popcorn and the happi meal . this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolut necessari in everi way . without that someth extra -- whether it a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effect or great locat or great cast or great perform or great big hungri dinosaur -- the movi fail . that whi the jackal , with all it starpow , with all it budget , with all it hype , get a big fat f . bruce willi is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendari killer for hire . richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal . the jackal is tri to kill someon . gere is tri to stop him . will gere be abl to stop the assassin in time and kill the jackal ? ( i'll give you three guess , and the first two don't count . ) there are no surpris await the audienc in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , " i wonder what happen next ? " the script for the jackal isn't rip straight from today headlin . it rip off , straight from an episod of millennium . throughout the movi , we learn what the jackal plan are and how he intend to accomplish them . no surpris . the fun of a movi like this should come from richard gere figur out what the jackal plan is and develop a clever plan to foil the bad guy . instead , we get two ( count em , two ) scene where gere is sit in an fbi confer room somewher and instant divin the jackal plan just as if he frank black ( or more like , just as if he been hand a copi of the script ) . and we never get more than a superfici clue as to whi gere has had this flash of insight . it like gere charact is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwrit ) seem to know it . and just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelm need to go after the peopl the good guy care about , whether or not they are import to what he tri to do or not . what more , in the last half of the movi , the jackal , suppos a super-smart profession terrorist who never make a mistak , come down with a major case of the stupid . as for the perform . . . bruce willi manag to get through the whole movi without a wisecrack , which is a major achiev , but not enough reason to see the movi . his disguis are good , but not as good or as interest as val kilmer in the saint . richard gere is made to talk the entir movi in an irish accent , which detract from his otherwis lifeless and dull perform . sidney poitier is probabl the most disappoint element in a overwhelm disappoint movi -- not that his perform is bad or anyth , it not , but it is sad that hollywood won't use this talent actor in ani part other than an fbi agent ( shoot to kill , sneaker ) . write a good plot and a good screenplay , like i said , is hard , but it can be done . it wasn't done here . it is our job as consum to reward good screenplay and to denounc bad and uninterest one . do not go see this movi . you'll onli encourag the produc to make more just like it . instead , stay home and rent day of the jackal , or in the line of fire , or a fire safeti video , for cri out loud . anyth other than the jackal , which live up to it name by gnaw the dead bone of other , better movi .
1 in my review of there someth about mari , i said someth to the effect of " laughter isn't everyth .

1 glory--star matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--i the true stori of the 54th regiment of massachusett , the first black fight unit recruit by the north dure the civil war . broderick play robert gould shaw , the young white offic who led the black soldier into battl . shaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionist , hail from boston high societi . the letter he wrote home to his parent dure the war are on display at harvard , and were , evid , the inspir for glori . as the film begin in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forc . like privat eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualti of war , shaw initi is naiv and idealist about the war--that is , until his compani is attack by enemi forc . shaw experi first hand the horror and chao of battl , wit mass slaughter and receiv a minor wound himself when a bullet graze his neck . soon after his recoveri , shaw is promot to colonel and assign to enlist and train black in the war effort . glori is the stori not onli of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldier who laid down their live to free their brother from slaveri . the film period jump between shaw point of view and the perspect of the black soldier . the movi introduc us to a hand of black recruit , and we follow them from their enlist through basic train and final into action . the larg black cast is uniform outstand , especi washington who is electrifi as a runaway slave with a big mouth . he is brash and pushi , alway get into troubl and alway look for a fight . his bitter , tough guy facad is realli just a mask for his loneli and vulner . washington provid much of the film intens and emot power . in one heartbreak scene , he is whip for alleg desert the armi . when he remov his shirt to receiv the punish , you cring at the sight of his back , which is riddl with ugli scar from his day as a slave . it make your blood boil . the humili of the beat is far more traumat than the actual physic pain it bring ; a tear roll down washington cheek--and will probabl run down your cheek as well . the episod becom even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't desert the armi at all ; he left camp to look for shoe becaus his feet were cover with ooz sore . freeman is , as usual , a strong presenc , even in a small support role . he play a grave digger who has buri more white soldier than he care to rememb . he quick becom a leader among the black soldier , hold the group togeth and serv as a liaison to the white offic . colonel shaw recogn freeman leadership abil and promot him to sergeant major , make him the first black offic in the armi . andr braugher make an impress film debut in the role of thoma searl , a free black who is one of shaw close childhood friend . searl is educ and refin , like a white man , prompt washington to nicknam him " snow flake . " the burn question is whether searl is tough enough to surviv basic train and to kill in combat . the road from march drill to battl action is a bumpi one for the black regiment . the soldier suffer innumer hardship , but somehow they never lose their moral . the armi treat the black soldier like second class citizen , subject them to racism and discrimin . they are paid onli $10 a month , wherea their white counterpart earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoe , gun , or uniform . to make matter wors , the white militari hierarchi is extrem reluct to allow the black into action , prefer instead to use them for manual labor . eventu , howev , the regiment receiv it boot , uniform , rifl , and right to fight , thank to the stubborn resolv of colonel shaw . shaw has absolut faith in his soldier , and he fight tooth and nail to get them what they deserv , even if it mean threaten a general with blackmail . broderick , in fact , is most convinc in the scene where shaw stand up for the regiment . unfortun , howev , broderick uneven perform is , in mani respect , the weak link in the movi . in an effort to look more matur , broderick sport a mustach and a goate , and throughout the film he slip in and out of a phoni boston accent . he is never altogeth convinc as shaw sinc much of the time his emot seem forc . the film place too much weight on broderick charact and not enough on the black soldier , who are more intrigu . glori regain lost ground with it harrow depict of war . the movi show the devast of war without resort to the unnecessarili graphic gore which mar born on the fourth of juli . glori doe not tri to rattl you with nauseat blood and gut . except for a few bullet wound and one explod head , the film , for the most part , leav the gore to your imagin , which is not to say that the battl scene in glori are timid . to the contrari , they are chaotic and horrifi ; it just that director edward zwick ( the co-creat of " thirtysometh " ) film them with far more subtleti and restraint than oliv stone could ever muster . the key to glori is the group dynam among the black soldier . the movi depict some of ( but not enough of ) their custom and ritual . in one scene , for exampl , the soldier motiv themselv by sing prayer around the campfir . each man has a chanc to relay a few word of inspir . a coupl of the movi most touch moment involv young black children look up to the black soldier with awe , disbelief and pride . the regiment greatest triumph come when the soldier distinguish themselv in battl , therebi earn the respect of their white peer and earn the honor of lead the climact assault on fort wagner . like ani war film , glori has it share of gloom and despair , but ultim it prove to be a truli uplift experi and an import histori lesson , a valuabl remind that despit what the histori book say ( or , more precis , what they do not say ) , black play a critic import role in the north victori over the south--forev chang the evolut of america .
1 the word rest in the titl should be stress sinc this is a movi that lack ani action scene at all . what doe take place is more base on charact develop . the film start right in the middl of the live of four peopl : nick , beth , carol and sid . what they have done earlier is for the most part onli hint at . nick and beth have a relationship and have decid to move from enfield , arizona to butt , montana . ( and i who thought that butt was pronounc slight differ . . . ) carol is nick ex-girlfriend and beth best friend , sid is a joint-smok painter that come to repaint their hous befor the new tenant move in . obvious base on a stage play , the problem with the movi is that there a lot of thing left out . it not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason whi nick was fire from his job isn't mention . and whi nick sudden decid to go visit his parent remain a mysteri , when he hasn't seen them for mani year . set in a small ( fiction ? ) town in arizona was a good move , sinc this make the film focus on the four charact and not on their surround . the name of the citi is not import , this could take place anywher with four young peopl in a hous discuss life and the futur . particular impress is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fianc nick leav her . not an actress that i have found interest earlier or seen mani pictur with , but i'll keep an eye on her in the futur . interest trivia : this was rate r in the us but rate barntil ? ten in sweden wich mean that anyon at ani age can see it .

" virus " is the type of movi that realli make you wonder what the screenwrit was think about when he wrote it . besid the lame " monster " , it chock full of dialogu that no real person would ever say , and situat that no real person would ever allow themselv to get into . for exampl , there is a scene late in the movi in which one of the charact actual attempt to * negoti * with the alien ! now , i don't know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that view mankind as a virus to be elimin , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it . that make about as much sens as a babi squirrel calm ask a fierc predat to spare his life . final , " virus " isn't scari . the least the filmmak could have done was to make the movi just a littl scari . as it is , it about as frighten as a box of cooki . skip " virus " . if it a cool monster movi you want , rent the far superior ( and the granddaddi of this genr ) " alien " .

1 martin scorses triumphant adapt of edith wharton the age of innoc is a stun film for the quintessenti new york filmmak , the man who brought the street of taxi driver and mean street to life . it seem like an odd choic for scorses to do a period piec in the earli 1900 , but the fact that he pull it off so brilliant is a wonder , and a testament to the great of scorses as a filmmak . this is a gorgeous visual experi that it sure one of scorses finest . newland archer ( day-lewi ) is a prestigi lawyer who is engag to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empti and shallow new yorker , who belong to a prestigi famili and is quit beauti . the marriag is one which will unit two veri prestigi famili , in a societi where noth is more import than the opinion of other . on the day that archer is to announc his engag to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walk into archer life . archer is immedi captiv , and find himself in love with ellen . archer is also bound by the limit of new york societi , which is an intrus as ani other in the world . archer find himself have a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempt to keep her in his mind while tri not to lose his social status . the film subject matter may seem alien to scorses , but the theme is definit not . it is a theme of forbidden romanc , guilti pleasur , and the consequ caus becaus of those action . there is a painstak flaw hero , and his choic between the life he want , and the life he is destin for . in truth , it is a film about a societi the audienc doesn't know about , but want to find out more , much like the societi of goodfella or even kundun . the perform are absolut breathtak . day-lewi portray more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forc to take . pfeiffer is marvel as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauti that the audienc would die for as well . ryder is probabl the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presenc that overwhelm the plot , and slowli push day-lewi closer and closer to his eventu end . the support cast is also wonder , with sever charact so singular that they are indel in one memori . scorses definit has a passion for filmmak . his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvel recreat of new york is a wondrous sight . he liter transport the viewer to anoth world with incred imageri . his script is also excel , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclus and a fantast end that has to be seen to be believ . it is difficult to make a period piec grip : scorses , howev , doe it beauti . the famous camera of the legendari director are also everywher . he is patient , but he film everyth and anyth remot import . the camera sweep , pan , track , and do more than they'v ever done , but they are so subtl , one doesn't realiz he watch all the scorses hallmark until a 2nd view . the central track shot is probabl longer and more complex than the famous goodfella shot , but the viewer doesn't notic it , becaus we want to see more of this gorgeous world . there are a few deft touch of filmmak that are simpli outstand , and joann woodward narrat is exquisit . not a fast film like goodfella , this share more in common with kundun than anyth els . and like kundun , this is a slow-start film that truli shine , when given the chanc to fulli breath and bloom in the end . a beauti film by a director continu to challeng himself year after year .
0 _soldier_ is hand down one of the worst movi a person could ever have to sit through that doesn't have jean claud van damm in it . i could liken it to the sci-fi chees that was the hollywood product-of-choic back in the earli 80s , but that would be too much of a compliment . if there is a movi theater in hell , this film is play there 24 hour a day . the stori , such that there is , revolv around todd ( kurt russel ) , an automaton of a man who has been rais from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not-too-dist ultra-conserv futur ( is there ani other kind ? ) after year of desensit at a militari academi full of other boy just like him , todd becom a ground fighter in a seri of war all over the galaxi . who the enemi in these war are is never reveal , but the few glimps of todd in battl show that it doesn't matter , becaus innoc hostag are wipe out as indiffer as the bad guy . after ten minut of this nihilist trash -- yes folk , there more -- we see todd as a buff , scar adult , now so accustom to the carnag that no confront at all caus him to break a sweat . there a new wrinkl , though . todd and his brethren are declar obsolet , and a new batch of soldier take their place . after lose a sanction battl with _dragon_ jason scott lee , the seem dead todd is dump by a fli ice-cub tray ( well , that what is look like ) on a remot garbag planet . if you predict that todd meet a bunch of outcast settler on this planet , and that they band togeth to fight a bunch of bad guy come to destroy them , you'r way ahead of the game . the renegad societi on this trash heap is so clich you half-expect tina turner and master blaster to come stroll into frame ani minut . it surpris that _soldier_ is the brain-child of _blade runner_ co-writ david webb peopl . unlik that mind-twist classic , this film contain just bare enough dialogu to fill about three double-spac page . add into the mix the _mortal kombat_ paul anderson inept direct , and it easi to see how _soldier_ turn out so bad . and the special effect ! rememb the fli steam iron in hardwar war ? gari busey is in this movi . nuff said . _soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenti of bad idea sit in it script vault . that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourag plenti of aspir screenwrit out there that there is hope after all . now if you'll excus me , i have to go weep for the futur .
1 seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgat cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #15 , by myself for free use my hoyt critic pass . [theater rate : * * * 1/2 : veri good seat , sound and picture] do you realiz that everi time you encount a new person you'v just becom part of a stori ? everyon has their own life stori , both past and present , and everi time two or more interact , they becom part of each other stori ( not necessarili an import or even signific part , but a part nevertheless ) . that seem to be the basic theori behind `go , ' where sever charact chanc encount all effect each other in extrem way . in order to test this theori screenwrit john august and director doug liman assembl a cast of charact that wouldn't usual be the type to have an entir film revolv around them , such as a teenag supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggl soap opera actor . these type of charact might not sound all that origin , but consid that they will all be somehow effect by a strip club bouncer and his psychot father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsess with multi-level-market , horni wed guest , a zen lovemak , two shrimp-scarf and a cute normal teenag girl to round thing out . how they will all come togeth is the process the film deal with . i'd imagin the concept to the film start out as the creator test themselv to see if they could actual pull it off and the outcom is a terrif achiev in filmmak and the craft of fiction in general . the film start out as anyth els , with littl indic of what to come . we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depress los angel checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desir to do anyth except work just to pay her rent . she not veri charm , especi to her custom , but this is play most for laugh rather than character and it work . mayb this is becaus she not a veri afeminit charact , but she far from masculin - a creativ charact inde . thing start to progress when ronna reluct agre to take the hour of the goofi , hyperact , yet likabl simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vice for the sake of the experi . this agreement start a three-prong storylin as it allow simon to go to las vega for the weekend with his friend and in turn drag ronna and her friend into buy and sell an experiment drug . the process of which will not onli bring ronna close to be arrest but also to death . near the same can be said for two other charact , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as support charact , but later will becom major player to the film makeup - anoth process use by the filmmak to elabor on the theori of how signific insignific interact might be . onc the pace is pick up the film realli begin to show it mettl . when the titl screen `ronna is flash short after the aforement turn point scene , it clear this film isn't go to employ the standard linear method of storytel . consid how good it is up until that point , it a long overdu chang of pace need in movi today . and so the film begin to take shape , first by follow ronna and her friend on a one-night adventur that begin with a drug deal instig by zack and adam ( who were actual look for simon ) , which doesn't exact go as plan , but that what keep it all so interest . the second storylin start at the same moment as ronna stori , but this time the camera choos to follow simon instead . simon and his three friend head to ? vega for a night on the town and in the process experi thing they never would have imagin . the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlap with ronna stori tell much of the same stori but from a complet differ angl . we'r shown thing we never would have expect were go on while follow ronna . and mani of the event that do happen to ronna becaus of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happen to be where they were when they were . i'd realli like to dissect each of the three storylin and especi how the film wrap up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everyth for those who haven't seen the film . perhap the greatest element to the film is it constant surpris and unpredict , and not due to plot twist or a confus screenplay , just through great filmmak . still , i can list and analyz near everyth the film doe so well : ? direct : tri to piec togeth such a complex stori is no easi task and for a rooki filmmak such as liman , it a great accomplish . he doesn't just depict a stori , he wrap us up in it all , pull us into the fray so that we experi everi high and low . ? screenplay : besid be chisel with detail and creativ in general , it clear the script has been inspir by mani sourc , with both obvious and subtl refer , yet it never scream `rip-off . ' ? tone/mood : where other hollywood film have fail to bring the charm of the independ to the mainstream , this one is abl to creat it own sens of the macabr . it not overly-dark or twist and the comedi isn't so satir for it to be consid a black comedi , more like `macabr light . ' ? cinematography/art direct : abl to photograph both the intens and the lightheart in the same manner . ? character : for near everi charact introduc , no matter what role they play in the big pictur , we'r abl to get a sens of who they are , what they'r think and how they came to be in their situat . even when their action are surpris , it never seem veri out of synch . ? perform : everi actor nail their role ( see abov ) . ? theme/theori : the film doesn't seem to be concern with convey ani kind of polit or social messag , instead , it more of a philosoph experi . in fact , it might not have meant to do that intent , but there definit is someth existenti to it all . . . . and to think that `go is just a big comedi and adventur !

1 " when you get out of jail , you can kill him . " star ashley judd , tommi lee jone , bruce greenwood . rate r . doubl jeopardi is a lurid , prepostr thriller that also one of the year most enjoy . it an uncompromis brutal , cheer anarch , hyperact action that has a mission and never divert from it . there is not a moment here when the event on screen don't have a direct bear on the plot ; onc the film get go it never stop . it has been brand as the femal version of the fugit and that probabl a correct assess of the plot , but the film itself has littl in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collabor besid the presenc of star tommi lee jone . not even bother with charact introduct , director bruce beresford floor the gas pedal from the get-go and never find the brake . we meet , rather hastili , libbi and nick parson ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respect ) a seem happi marri coupl , with a son matti , age 4 . they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin sex , they go to sleep . libbi hear a strang nois , wake up and discov that she is cover with blood . she follow a red trail to the upper deck , where she find a knife and , out of astonish , pick it up . at that conveni moment , the coast guard show up and libbi is arrest . her lawyer , a friend , put up a defens in court , but though we know she is innoc , the evid against her is too compel . her friend adopt her son and she goe to prison . onc in prison , she make a phone call to her friend . her friend give her son the phone . nick walk in the room . littl matti scream " daddi ! " the phone goe dead . libbi realiz that the man she is imprison for kill isn't even dead . she get some advic from a prisoner/form lawyer , who tell her that sinc the state alreadi convict her of kill her husband , they can't convict her of the same crime again , mean that when she get parol she can kill him and they can't touch her . after a weird short amount of time , she get out of parol . she is sent to live at a hous with other recent parole , under the command of parol offic travi lehman ( tommi lee jone ) . she set out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turn out to be much more difficult than anticip . she wind up track him all the way to new orlean where she find out that he has long kill his girlfriend and her son " adopt " . doubl jeopardi is base on an assumpt that is legal fals . the law state that nobodi can be convict twice for the same crime assum that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumst . it not like it matter . this is a rollick good thriller ; intens , excit , fast and furious . it silli alright , but this is the kind of film you just don't question . in some film , plausibl is everyth . doubl jeopardi , howev , is not concern with make sens : it sole purpos is to entertain , and it doe . judd help the film tremend in a difficult role . this is her breakout box-offic perform , and she is terrif . she bring some emot to what could have been a one-dimension role , give the movi a littl soul to go along with it effect chase scene and action set piec . tommi lee jone basic just repris the role for which he won an oscar in the fugit , but the movi make good use of his stone-fac wit . thank , too , doubl jeopardi refrain from develop a romanc between libbi and travi ; a subplot which doubtless would have interf with the film stori . this is one of those movi where cop are the bad guy , and i took a sort of sick pleasur in that . the sheer anarchi of the proceed was noth short of wonder , as ashley judd kick the crap out of everi author figur in the book . after all the idealist hollywood featur featur hero cop , deft fbi agent and the virtu of the american legal system , it great to see a movi that doesn't so much demonstr their fallaci as it delight in their failur . doubl jeopardi is realli good , but it isn't the kind of good that is rememb or recogn with award . it one of those movi better view with the brain turn off , otherwis , your brain will be busi ruin your experi . this is a thriller that isn't concern with be smart or plausibl . instead it divert all attent to the action , which , this year , is second to none .
0 martial art master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of play an alleg fictiti martial art superman who never get hurt in fight , talk in a hush tone , and squint at ani sign of danger . he also the most consist individu in hollywood today , sinc all his movi suck . they basic repres his egotisit tendenc about his art ( that is , martial art ) . i'm sure the guy good , and he seem like a nice guy on talk show , although a tad haughti , but these movi he make are all the same : a guy who is basic indestruct , is mayb wound suppos mortal , then come back with a vengeanc and goe buddha on all the baddi ass ( although i kinda like " under sieg " ) . of cours , this one , as a chang , has a " messag " that is drill into our mind . . . of cours , after he blow up a lot of stuff and kill a bunch of peopl . so whi do i watch his crap ? i usual don't . i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man movi , unless , and onli unless , he in a support role ( i . e . " execut decis " ) and i'd definit pay if he die ( i . e . " execut decis " ) . but this one has a special place in my heart . this doesn't mean it good or that i even like it . this was the last movi i watch with my deceas uncl , and we had one hell of a time rip it apart a la " mysteri scienc theatr 3000 , " and this was a coupl year befor i had heard of " mysteri scienc theatr 3000 . " in this one , seagal play a worker for a mine factori set in alaska and run by the greased-up typic shallow villain , this time play by an oscar-winn to give the movi some more clout - michael cain . it seem that cain want to do someth with his oil factori that includ him dump oil all over inuit land . around the 20-30 minut point , seagal speak up to him in what seem to be the typic speech to all the vain entrepeneur ( what with his new " fire down below , " anoth " messag film " ) , and cain has him bump off . . . or doe he ? seagal is rescu by some inuit , and fall in love with one of them , play by joan chen , who can act , hypothet , but , for some reason , not here . one of cain clich henchmen ( play here with a lot of overact by john c . mcginley ) shoot the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyag to take down the oil factori . . . liter , of cours . at one point , seagal give a wonder hyster speech about how he doesn't have ani option but blow stuff up . he even goe as far as to say , " i don't want to kill someon , " and in the same breath , he ask some guy where the arsenal is . i have no problem with violenc . i'm a huge john woo fan , but he paint his film with suspens , skill , style , depth , character , and just plain cool violenc . in the film of seagal , the suspens main consist of the baddi attack him stupid , and him either wound or kill them . at some point , they use the clich of the talk villain , where the villain has the advantag , can shoot seagal , but begin talk by either tell him his big secret plan , or say a corni line , to which seagal say someth hokey back , and has had enough time to devis of a way to do away with them , and doe . this would be okay if there were ani suspens or if it didn't take itself serious at all , like in the case of this summer " con air . " but seagal is serious about his skill , and of cours , his messag . i wouldn't mind if this was a messag film in the way that they present it to you with evid . but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the messag is subtl , not pound into the viewer mind . the villain is total shallow and cartoonish , thus we can't take him and his motiv serious , and while seagal talk about be kind to the environ , he also goe ahead and blow up a squar mile of rig , and kill some worker who were just do his job . then at the end , he spend a good 10 minut give a speech , just in case you didn't get the messag from the trailer . what seagal doesn't realiz is that no one take his film serious ( although mayb a coupl do ) and ani messag he has is no onli redund , but doesn't comfort fit in his film , which is fill to the brim with hokey violenc , crap suspens , stupid melodrama , and charact who have about as much emot depth as a petri dish . as far as seagal and his act , he rather bore . he squint , he kill . period . noth els . oh , yeah , there corni one-lin ( " i'm gonna reach out and touch someon ! " ) . of cours , he the star , and we'r suppos to root for him and all , so he make all the villain unbeliev stupid and a bunch of jerk . michael cain , who a great actor , is just suppos to yell and look cold . he doe it well , i guess , but this is no " alfi . " of cour , no one was expect that calib of perform from him . his big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda bore as well , but is not horribl . and we even get a small perform from that god of drill sergeant on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from " full metal jacket " ) as a hire assasin squad leader who get to say the obligatori speech about how danger seagal is , just for the movi trailer and for seagal ego . and also , look for billi bob thornton as one of ermey assasin . anyway , to conclud this all , to judg one of seagal movi is to judg all of them ( except for " under sieg " and " execut decis , " though the latter is not realli a " seagal movi " ) . they all have this same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but this one has that messag , which make it more excrucit to watch . i mean , if you do rent it , and i don't reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minut . but i have to put it to seagal for creat a film so bad , that the last film i view with my uncl was a pleasur one . my ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock )
0 in our time . in our modern world , where the cool rule , it hard to imagin that shakespear is becom the man . and yet - film after film , after film , is base on his everlast magic . in warner brother latest product , shakespear is kick ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intellig slowli fade away . though the produc of the matrix have vagu base their pictur on william shakespear romeo and juliet , it titl sequenc with a frighten rap song and a black limo make it way through the dark street of new york , is veri hard to associ with shakespear poetri . the film take place dure a silent war between the two major mafia famili in the citi - the afro american against the chines . the youngest son of a chines mafia chieftain is found murder . the afro-american are immedi suspect , but a peac treati is sign between the two godfath . it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the stori ) find out about his brother death . escap from a prison in china , he return to unit state to aveng his brother fate . but befor he can restor justic with his kung fu kick , he fall in love with a mysteri beauti . the onli problem is that she is the daughter of his enemi . . there onli a weak echo of shakespear talent in this disappoint product . and there are more problem besid it titl . of cours we don't call it a deform of a great masterpiec . we call it modern . it seem that the produc fear that the audienc will not respond to lyric , without ani car chase and gun fight . this lack of respect for the audienc i find veri disturb . kenneth brannagh has alreadi proven that shakespear doesn't need to be updat , becaus his tale are ground in the basic of life and human natur . and as long as love , hate , honesti and corrupt do exist , everyon will understand and embrac shakespear . i must admit that i found rome must die veri confus . i can forgiv andrzej bartkowiak , sinc it is his first attempt at direct . he manag to creat an incred atmospher and direct with a firm precis . unfortun he complet forgot about character- and stori develop . his latest pictur is therefor visual impress , but intellectu hollow . the love stori between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigu are undevelop and simplifi . jet li is one of the most amaz fighter to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magic voic . their achiev save this film from be complet braindead , but they are not actor , and therefor can not act . they are noth more than two celebr put togeth . the other actor , includ isaiah washington , russel wong , henri o and dmx all give the standard mediocr perform . delroy lindo is the onli one that project a coher imag of realiti . but there more than act to worri about . even with li incred skill in martial art , the action scene ( though technic excel ) are too long and stori updat simpli embarrass . to make a long stori short : romeo must die is not intellig enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love stori and too serious to be a fun action film . it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrass and complet unnecessari parallel to romeo and juliet , so the film is complet stuck - not sure of what to be . and in the end it noth . there are no perform worthi of notic , no interest character- or stori surpris . so again , the onli good thing about it is it technic achiev . this film can boast of great sound , fast pace edit , solid cinematographi and some veri well coordin action sequenc . the music is anoth factor that prevent you from leav the theatr . it is most provid by aalyah enchant voic and sever care insert rap song by various artist , that creat a kind of ghetto feel to it . but when i think back , it not much i rememb from this product . as in almost everi summer movi , there are some interest scene , but most of the moment that i rememb are associ with massiv special effect . it is not a film that will get ani attent for it artist qualiti , simpli becaus it doesn't have ani . for someon who has never read shakespear , it anoth popcorn film . for those of us who has , it a wast of money , time and brain cell .
0 i saw this film on christma day expect an upbeat comedi . boy was i in for a christma dissapoint ! after an hour of the movi , i was readi to chang rooms-into anoth theater ! read on to see what i have to say . . . . four room : star : tim roth , jennif beal , antonio bandera , quentin tarantino , valeria golino , madonna , bruce willi , marisa tomei , alicia witt , lili taylor , and ion skye . possibl star ) " four room " was suppos to be one of the biggest hit of the year . key word here : " suppos .

0 i'm guess -- and from the avail evid , it not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insid satir of hollywood excess , stupid , ego and power-mong . if so , the film that end up on the screen rank as one of the most spectacular iron unintent joke in film histori . it has alreadi been well-docu that the origin titl , an alan smithe film , becam a problem when miser test screen forc re-cut against the will of director arthur hiller , prompt hiller himself to opt for the director guild-mand pseudonym of alan smithe . that left a film satir in the hand of writer joe eszterha , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor . and you could just smell the disast brew . if you'r unfortun enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you'll still be smell that disast long after the light come up . ostens , it a pseudo-documentari account of a director name alan smithe ( eric idl ) who lose control of a big-budget action film call trio star sylvest stallon , whoopi goldberg and jacki chan ( all of whom appear as themselv ) . when the onli recours avail to him is abandon the project to be call " an alan smithe film " -- which , of cours , it alreadi is -- smithe steal the negat of the film and threaten to destroy it . among the parti interview are the film produc jame edmund ( ryan o'neal ) and studio boss jerri glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtual the entir film narrat the stori while pain unfunni thing go on around them . it bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- liter -- not a singl laugh for it entir , bliss brief 84 minut . what make it even wors is eszterha insist upon tell everi bad joke not onc , but twice or even three time . michael ovitz refer , showgirl refer , oral sex refer , whoopi goldberg/t danson refer -- all show up multipl time with all the subtleti that is eszterha stock-in-trad . the redunc even manag to turn activ offens with some frequenc , notabl with the hilari use of the word " feminist " as an identifi caption for everi singl femal charact in the film . by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independ film-mak the brother brother ( clever identifi as " bad a-- " and " badder a-- " , among other unprint thing ) , you may be readi to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid be identifi . those documentari caption , for all their leaden obvious , allow the best insight into what so hideous wrong with burn hollywood burn . not content to stick ani hollywood type with onli one jab from his rapier wit , eszterha fill the screen with bullet point everi time a new charact appear . the produc is a " liar " who " slept in the white hous ; " the media are " maggot " and " leech " work for public like " the new york slime " and " newsleak " ( with the camera zoom in on the alter titl to make sure you don't miss the joke ) . it doesn't even matter that eszterha tag " penil implant " after his own name when he make a cameo , becaus it seem like such a desper attempt to feign self-deprec . this is a petul schoolboy idea of satir -- pictur of hollywood insid to which eszterha has taken a pen to draw littl moustach and black out the teeth . the last stomach-churn straw come when burn hollywood burn close with out-tak over the close credit , the kind that show the audienc how much fun everyon was have make the film that just suck an hour and a half of your life away . perhap it was just a final , desper attempt by eszterha to convinc himself there was some purpos behind the film , or to convinc everyon involv that a few blown line warrant threaten to blow their whole career . piti everyon involv with this excess , ego-driven " satir " of excess and ego . it too bad that onli director can remov their name from noxious materi like this . otherwis , you might have seen credit for burn hollywood burn overflow with alan smithe .
1 the most amaz thing about paul cox innoc is how unlik a movi it is . i mean that as the highest compliment . if most studio were to profil an elder coupl who rekindl a 40-year-old romanc , i'd want to run and hide . the sex scene would be handl as a farc , produc would shed 20 year off the charact age ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through ani obstacl without explan and consequ . along with a charm romant stori , the australian/belgian innoc show how an increas sens of mortal combin with revisit the past while be entrench in the present can make someth that seem so right seem downright question . the romanc get start when former musician andrea ( charl " bud " tingwel ) , learn that his true love , clair ( julia blake ) , live nearbi . they decid to catch up on old time , but soon find themselv in a reinvigor affair . complic matter is andrea frail health , and clair longtim husband ( terri norri ) , who can't understand whi he sudden becom obsolet . in my mind , the movi is less about the relationship between andrea and clair , than the feel of everyon involv . john , clair husband , endless question what he did wrong . clair initi insist she a grown-up , but admit behav like a child , a prospect that thrill and disappoint her . andrea , an agnost , begin to question his fate , a messag cox deliv in a memor dream sequenc . cox litter the movi with flashback , includ the repeat vision of a roar train . it a remind of andrea and clair past love ( as young lover , they met by train ) , but as it recur , we get the feel that the past and the present have clash . a pall is cast on the whole affair . a master of the underst , cox string togeth a seri of memor moment . in andrea dream sequenc , amidst the roar of the train and convers , we get the whole pictur of andrea and clair love . we also get glimps into john and clair relationship . dure a silent candlelit dinner short afterward , clair admit to john about her indiscret , tell more than ani monologu could . all that heard is the scrape of fork against plate . the charact are unlik anyth i'v seen -- they'r peopl . so mani time , movi and especi televis portray senior citizen as grate spunki . or they'r reduc to comed buffoon . ordinari peopl with a pile of emot , clair and andrea aren't sure what the next step is . they do want to be happi , which consist of an entir differ set of condit than what they'v known throughout their adult live . bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not make john a monster , so that clair affair is automat justifi . norri is so effect as john that he make andrea and clair love difficult to accept . we feel for him . he a decent man . sure , he may have becom complac , but he never expect this , especi now . with so much present to the audienc , it onli expect that the materi get a littl drawn out and repetit , which it doe . howev , in bring up tough question and not offer easi answer , cox display a skill and ? lan isn't like to be surpass by anyon anytim soon .
0 the film may be call mercuri rise , but that titl doesn't describ the trajectori taken by this motion pictur , a routin thriller that combin govern cover-up with a cloy and poorly-motiv buddi stori . the " hook " that is suppos to make mercuri rise uniqu is that the young protagonist is autist . howev , asid from give actor miko hugh a chanc to win rave for his perform , this particular aspect of the film come across as noth more than a conveni plot devic . those expect to see even a semi-thorough explor of the condit will be disappoint . mercuri rise treat autism with the same degre of effici that mani action thriller accord to alcohol . the script for mercuri rise is except tiresom and hard- to-swallow . i don't know whether the problem is in the origin book , simpl simon , or in the screenplay adapt , but this movi easili exceed the intang threshold beyond which a suspens of disbelief is no longer possibl . onc again , certain standbi plot element -- the high-level govern conspiraci and the maverick law enforc agent -- are recycl , and not to good effect . while bruce willi can play the action hero as well as anyon in hollywood , this particular outing leav him maroon in situat that are character by too littl tension and too much nonsens . the stori begin with a formula sequenc in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffri ( bruce willi ) , is confront with his own failur . unabl to resolv a hostag crisi in time , he is forc to observ as two teenag are shot to death . the event weigh heavili on his conscienc and heavy-hand establish his motiv for protect 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hugh ) when he discov the autist child hide in a closet after his parent have been gun down by the evil hit man who look like an ex-footbal player . soon , art and simon are on the run from seem everyon -- flee for their live and bond at the same time , with the evil hit man who look like an ex-footbal player alway just a step behind them . along the way , they are help by the best friend who defi order to help out his buddi ( chi mcbride ) and the support femal who may or may not becom a love interest ( kim dicken ) . whi is simon in danger and whi were his parent turn into swiss chees by the evil hit man who look like an ex-footbal player ? appar , the govern has spent million of dollar develop an ultra-secret code call " mercuri . " to make sure it can't be crack , they do the most intuit thing possibl : place a sampl of it in a " nerd puzzl magazin . " of cours , no one can solv it -- no one except autist simon , that is . when he call the phone number list in the solut , he get the nsa . as a result , the cold-heart , sneer govern man ( alec baldwin ) decid that simon has to be elimin -- for the good of the countri , of cours . but he hasn't count on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyon in the audienc has . it hard to get work up about a routin thriller that doesn't do anyth except well , and doe quit a few thing rather poor . for those who are desper to find element of this movi to like , mercuri rise manag to manufactur tension from time-to-tim , but even the most excit scene ( such as the one where art and simon are crouch down , avoid pass train ) aren't that pulse-pound . the climact struggl is a real ho-hum affair which lead to a final that is pain in it obvious . overal , director harold becker is constant struggl ( and fail ) to generat even a moment that isn't deriv or obligatori . bruce willi star seem to be fade . this is his fourth straight lacklust outing , follow last man stand , the fifth element , and the jackal . willi isn't terribl , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often doe . alec baldwin , combin element of his charact from glengarri glenn ross and malic , doe some scenery- chew , but his perform is surpris lack in menac . the film real star is young miko hugh ( heather langenkamp son in wes craven new nightmar ) , who doe as good a job as dustin hoffman play an autist individu , but is about 50 year younger . mercuri rise join the like of hard rain , the replac killer , and u . s . marshal on the heap of pallid 1998 thriller . for those who like action and adventur in the theater , this has not been a good year . hope , the advent of summer will chang that . until then , the best choic ( for bruce willi or ani other action hero ) are on video . and , if you'r determin to see mercuri rise , check out the morn sky in earli may .
1 be the self-proclaim profession film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrass to admit that i had not seen lawrenc of arabia ( come soon to dvd ) until onli recent . after all , it consid by just about everyon to be the masterpiec epic of director david lean , who also direct film such as bridg on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago . so one day , a friend of mine loan me a copi of the video and i sat down and watch it . i was initi skeptic that someth made almost 40 year ago would be abl to keep my attent for the butt-numb 3 1/2 hour of it durat . but now i fulli understand whi this has becom the film that other epic film are judg against -- the winner of seven academi award in 1963 for best pictur , director , edit , cinematographi , art direct , music , and sound . after watch the film again , i am convinc that it is simpli one of the finest work of cinemat genius to ever illumin the big screen . base on the autobiograph write of british offic t . e . lawrenc dure world war i , lawrenc of arabia depict lawrenc ( play by then-unknown actor peter o'tool ) as a lieuten lack ani sort of militari disciplin whatsoev . bore with his assign of color map for the british armi in a dim lit headquart build , lawrenc jump at the opportun to be re-assign as an observ for an arabian princ fight against the turkish armi . lawrenc quick see just how care and great these desert dwell peopl can be and end up ralli the various tribe togeth to fight the turk and help the british turn the tide of world war i . shot in panavis fame super 70mm format , the film beauti illustr the definit of the word epic . it is absolut breathtak . use stun cinematographi , costum , and direct , shot in the most uninhabit locat on the face of the earth , i can onli imagin what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this stori unfold befor my eye . everi shot is choreograph as a portrait -- a live tribut to a great land . david lean put his reput on the line to get this film complet , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place say someth about the ideolog of the motion pictur industri at the time , a far cri from it pathet , uncreat exist today . after watch the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , " i'v got to do a remak of this film ! " but then i thought about tri to pitch the idea to a modern-day movi execut : " okay , it go to be almost four hour long and shot over three month on locat in the sahara desert . we are go to need to blow up a full-siz train becaus computer-gener effect probabl wont do it justic . and we are not go to use ani big star , and won't have ani femal actor sinc there no love stori . " yes , my friend , the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of hollywood a long time ago . but at least we still have the proof to show all would-b produc and director out there just how good a film can be .
1 in this good natur , pleasent and easi go comedi , bill murray ( ghostbust , 1984 ) play grumpi weatherman phil conner , who , everi year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . the groundhog day ceremoni involv a groundhog be lift out of a box , and if he dosen't see a shadow , it will be an earli spring . phil realli hate the ceremoni , and not even his produc rita ( macdowel ) can chang his mind . howev , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he start re-liv groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradual like it , and rita fall in love with him . groundhog day is a well written , totat unoffens and funni comedi . the screenwrit , director rami and danni rubin , have written a funni , warm , but never over senitment comedi . although the idea of a day repeat over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good joke to hold the audienc attent throughout the whole film . rami direct also help , and although he dosen't tri ani flash director trick , the film is direct well enough , and the joke are set up well . and the edit is also good , especi when it show one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tri to have the perfect night with rita . the perform are also excel . bill murray is great fun , and his transist from cynic to happi is smooth , and deliv his line in his usual smari style . andi macdowel is good as rita , although sometim she is just a littl bit too sweet in some part of the film . there is chemistri between the two lead , thank , otherwis the whole film would probabl fall part . chris elliot , as the cameraman larri , is also funni , although you have to like his goofi style , otherwis you are realli go to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoy of the film overal . the support cast aren't bad either , with stephen tobolowski hillar as phil old school mate ned ryanson , and even director rami pop up as a neurologist . in fact , there is not one dud perform in this film , and even the groundhog get a funni scene involv a car chase . overal , there is realli noth wrong with groundhog day at all . it almost seem perfect . howev , the film can get a bit soppi sometim , and some peopl may get irrit by the day repeat over , and over , and over , and over . also , there not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretti bad . but these critic hard affect the audienc enjoy at all . overal , then , groundhog day is a funni , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . an excel comedi . overal rating= (
0 1990s would rememb as the era of binari movi event in hollywood - two movi deal with the same subject , or , to be precis , same " high concept " . in summer 1994 , that " high concept " was " mad bomber action thriller " . in few week , " thrillrid of the summer " actionfest speed was follow by rather action thriller blown away , so disappoint that most of the peopl these day associ the titl with the 1992 thriller in which nicol eggert did few nude scene . the movi begin in the prison in northern ireland , where gaeriti ( tommi lee jone ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explos devic from almost ani materi , escap from prison . he come to boston , where he accident notic jimmi dove ( jeff bridg ) , dedic bomb dispos expert within boston polic . few peopl except gaeriti know the dove violent past , when he use to be ira terrorist befor becom sick with violenc , betray gaeriti and emigr to america where he chang the name and start use his experi for good purpos . gaeriti hold dove person respons for his captiv and begin the campaign of bomb terror , direct specif at dove colleagu , friend and relat . dove , who is just go to retir and start famili , now must confront the mad bomber . while speed doesn't even tri to bother with plot and charact , use them onli as an excus for long and spectacular action scene , blown away tri to be more convent and provid the action with some back stori . and that is the main reason whi it is inferior to speed . bad written plot and bad written charact are sometim wors than no plot and no charact at all . screenplay by john bateer and john rice , bare touch the complic issu of northern ireland , use the tragedi onli as the cheap backstori for even cheaper drama . the plot is , of cours , full of implaus . the main one is the fact that movi fail to explain how the singl individu , no matter how brilliant he is , can produc thousand of dead devic and hold entir citi at bay . those question , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goe on , but the paus between action scene are fill with clich and predict situat that should provid some background to the charact . becaus of them , movi seem a littl bit too long , and bore at time . the most annoy element of the film , howev , is tommi lee jone in the role of mad bomber . his act is so over-the-top that potenti fascin villain turn into pathet caricatur of himself . this role is in pain contrast with the strong perform given by that same actor in fugit . the film have few bright point , though . some of the action scene are fine , which should be credit to director stephen hopkin ( predat ii , judgement night ) . and forrest whitak realli shine in minor role of dove colleagu . but , all in all , blown away is a film that was justifi shadow by it more famous , yet hard unforgett competitor .
0 these day , peopl have rather short attent span and hard anyth can satisfi them for the long run . 1970s nostalgia is alreadi wear off , and now , peopl are becom more and more interest in 1980s . few year in the futur , earli 1990s are go to be regard as next golden age of nostalgia . howev , i doubt that peopl are go to be veri nostalg about the hollywood product of that period . one of the reason would sure be film like nation lampoon load weapon 1 , that , in mani way , symbolis the biggest problem of contemporari american film industri - lack of origin and idea . be made as some kind of parodi on lethal weapon seri , this film pair two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcohol cop on the edg , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , day away from retir . two of them , follow the murder of luger ex- partner , must confront evil general mortar ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is go to flood the market with cocain stash in wilder girl cooki . the author of this film ( whose director , gene quintano , work on such project like third and fourth sequel of polic academi ) lack ani origin idea befor they undertook the project , and that reflect in the lack plot , charact , and , even origin line . the plot , or what goe for the plot in this movi , is noth more than a seri of gag that make laugh of some popular film made in previous few year ( apart from lethal weapon seri , this film " borrow " it femal lead from basic instinct ) . the best gag , are , same as with mani other similar movi , shown in the trailer . the rest simpli doesn't work . onli those who use to watch a lot of hollywood product in that period would laugh . other would probabl winc at the lame of humour . some would be entertain by celebr cameo that pop up everi onc in a while . but , at the end , spend hour and half in front of this disorganis mess of a movi is simpli not worth the effort . the film was sometim criticis for be the parodi of a seri that alreadi had strong comic overton . the author of lethal weapon return the favour by use the load weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel .
1 those of you who frequent read my review are not like to be surpris by the fact that i have not read victor hugo novel les miser . i don't know if a lot of peopl have , though i imagin mani are familiar with the popular music base on the novel . i haven't even seen that . go into this film , i had almost no knowledg of the stori or it charact ( i even expect the film to be a music ) . walk away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experi with the materi . writer/director bill august film version is a straightforward , beauti told film . liam neeson star as the miser jean valjean ; in the begin , he has just been releas from a 19-year prison sentenc . he is allow to stay in a convent by a kind priest despit his rude and destruct behavior . the priest word of wisdom influenc him , and he make a vow to chang himself . nine year later , we are inform that he is now the mayor of a town call vigo ; nobodi know his real name , and that he is want for skip his parol nine year ago . conflict aris when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assign to vigo . valjean rememb javert as one of the prison guard who constant beat him , and javert rememb jean to be a convict . javert is hell-bent on uphold the law , and he doe everyth in his power to bring jean to justic . along the way , valjean meet and fall in love with a peasant woman , fantin ( uma thurman ) , and vow to take care of her daughter , cosett ( play later by clair dane ) . les miser is visual a solid and often strike pictur . the product design by anna asp is authent and vast , and the set don't look like set ( they look like real town and villag ) ; gabriella pescucci costum are notic spectacular . basil poledouri soundtrack is thick and usual well-plac ( though it doe get a bit heavi at time ) . mani scene in the film have a memor photograph qualiti , such as the climax , which take place next to a dark river in the grey obscur of earli even . august keep the stori simpl ( which i hear is a good thing , sinc the novel is so complex ) and easi to follow . he manag to develop the main charact and most of the subplot adequ . i was also impress that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is someth so mani director seem to be do to classic stori these day ( such as baz luhrmann vicious tragedi william shakespear romeo + juliet ) . this film feel solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of import and vigor that keep the audienc interest . liam neeson is terrif in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who doe solemn desper extrem well , and valjean is certain a man who clear fit that adject . thurman , in her small role , is veri good , and prove that she has a lot of rang and can perform in a veri non-glamor role such as this one . rush is absolut incred as javert ; i don't rememb ever feel so strong about a villain as i do here ; he add depth and complex with subtl glanc and nuanc , and effortless make each of his scene intens . i can't be as charit for dane , howev ; though i know she is a talent actress , here she tend to overact when it might have been better to underplay the charact a bit . les miser is , as i'v said , a solid , intellig motion pictur . my onli complaint is that it feel a bit too easi , and perhap too stage . each scene is grand and huge , and explod with poledouri score , but i didn't alway want them to be . for the most part , les miser is not a subtl or deep pictur . it a good movi , and tell it stori well , but august tend to hand-fe us theme and scene that would have work better had they been more subtl . howev , in a film this excit and well-produc , a few minor flaw are easili overlook .
0 with his success book and movi , michael crichton is do well . with earli success with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent film such as jurass park ( 1993 ) , his film have been entertain . howev , he seem to taken a wrong turn somewher with sphere . this $100 million mess by good director barri levison ( disclosur ) is dull , long wind , and a huge disappoint . consid the huge budget , the all star cast , and a stori by crichton , sphere is major disappoint . the film open with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who think he is visit an airplan crash to consol the survivor . howev , when he arriv , he his told by supervisor barn ( peter coyot ) that he is actual investig an spacecraft . along with goodman is mathematician harri adam ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted field ( liev schrieber . ) they investig the spaceship , find a massiv sphere insid , meet an alien intellig call jerri , and basic weird crap happen . unfortun , someth went wrong along the way with sphere . the film start off entertain enough , but throughout this veri long movi , it just get sillier and sillier . the film jaunt along from scene to scene , never fulli explain what is go on . the actor and direct don't help , either . hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seem embarrass ) throughout the movi , churn out dull line , and probabl wonder what the hell he is do in this movi . stone is useless , display no emot , and fail to convinc the audienc that she has ani feel for hoffman . the onli person who seem to be have fun in this movi is jackson , who funni as the mathematician who slowli goe crazi and enter the sphere . but he hard in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone . the same goe for peter coyot , who ham it up as the offic , but is then kill off halfway through . the director , barri levinson , who direct the better crichton adapt disclosur ( 1994 ) mess up with the drama and the action . the drama scene are , quit frank , bore , and the action scene suffer from overkil , with levison throw the camera all over the place ( much like the godaw speed 2 , 1997 ) the write doesn't help much , either . although crichton is great with plot , he terribl with dialogu , and practic everi line in sphere is a dud . the speech is too simpl , i was hope it would be a bit more intellig . practic everi line is just state the obvious . none of it is smart . also , where the hell did the budget go ? the sphere itself is impress , and there a few nice special effect shot , but where the $100 million went is anyon guess . there a giant squid attack in the pictur , but not onc doe the audienc see the squid , even though the film has a massiv budget . i assum the pictur was tri to build up tension by not show the squid , and if handl correct it probabl would . but the whole scene is done bad , and i was just hope we could see the stupid squid . final , the film has no idea what genr to be . levison can't handl his own plot . it leap from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and final the shining/ev horizon psycholog thriller . and , of cours , the film is veri much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it defens , crichton did write sphere befor the abyss was releas ( and is far superior to this rubbish . ) it not all that bad though . the plot is all right , there a few jump scene ( although noth veri scari ) and there the occasion interest bit . but overal , sphere is a big wast of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potenti good movi . not realli worth see . overal rating= review by david wilcock
0 everyth in the phantom you have seen mani time befor and there is noth new present here . wincer display absolut no skill in set up an excit action sequenc . billi zane is wooden as the hero . kristi swanson is given veri littl to do , and doe veri littl with it . treat william , look like rhett butler but sound like mickey mous , is one of the worst villain i have ever seen in a movi . onli catherin zeta jone , as one of william cohort turn in a good perform . she has energi and spunk , which the movi need much more of . oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret ident but this is so poor play out you won't even care . about the onli thing i can recommend are a good perform by jone , and some color sceneri . howev , if your look for a fun famili movi , go watch the underr flipper . this is not a good movi .
1 robert redford a river run through it is not a film i watch often . it is a masterpiec -- one of the better film of recent year . until 1994 , it was my second favorit film of all time . the act and direct is top-notch -- never sappi , alway touch . a friend of mine onc report that he avoid it becaus " i was afraid it would just be realli polit correct , and tick me off . " all i could do was tell him to go in unbias , and enjoy . it is one of the few movi that has complet reduc me to tear . but certain memori should not often be rereleas -- in the last few shot , you have to cri . upon my first view i left bawl . it is not flawless -- but it is so veri good , that you can't help but be effect . the open is danger nolstalg and sentiment -- watch these shot of peopl who have been dead so long , give you a feel of perspect and histori observ that you will find in veri few other film . martin scorses onc describ the movi as a dream state -- like take dope , and immers yourself in an altern world . that is what a river run through it doe . it exploit the uniqu power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self . both time i'v seen it , it been hard ( again to quot scorses ) wake up . but the dream is love .
0 everybodi in this film think of alicia . no , this is not a documentari on those of us after we first saw the " cryin " video . this is one of those erot thriller , but not like one star shannon whirri or shannon tweed . first off , there zero sex , almost no nuditi , and it not as well-plot as one of those tweed flick . well , anyway . the " plot . " alicia play , well , the babysitt , who is take care of some kid one night while the parent ( j . t . walsh and lee garlington ) go out to a parti . the film , tri to be like one of those introspect erot thriller , show everi charact thought , except alicia . the thing is alicia in most of them in most case , and the thought aren't too kosher . first off , there her boyfriend ( jeremi london , who gave one of the all-tim lousi perform in " mallrat , " and is onli a notch better here ) , who a dorki kid who hang out with a kind of bulli , play by nicki katt from " suburbia " ( who show he got that quiet creepi down pat onc again ) . they decid they want to crash her babysit job , look for the typic babysit hanky-panki . somethin like that . the film intercut between the subplot ( alicia babysit , nicki and jeremi , the parti ) and each charact thought . we get to see jeremi and nicki dream of do a littl threeway with alicia , j . t . think of come home to find alicia nake in the bathtub ( she has it all cover up , the littl teas ) , and , worst of all , lee garlington dream of that hunk , georg segal . it even show them in bed togeth . yea . i so want to see georg and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i'm use to georg after see her and mari tyler moor fool around in " flirt with disast . " the end is some kind of big tragedi thing , but come on . like we care about ani of the charact . the onli interest one is alicia , main becaus she alicia , and we most see her in the fantasi . so i guess she some kind of mysteri or someth . but she is never explor further . so , basic , this film is just a seri of mastabatori imag , sometim featur a non-nud alicia ( onc again , sad ) , sometim featur a scantily-clad georg segal ( onc again , sad ) . i watch this on one of those free preview of showtim or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the onli way to watch this film . i mean , there a reason they put these kind of film on late at night : they'r just as good as sleep pill . and this one is one big fat wast of time , even for an alicia film .
0 seen decemb 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinema ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) . [theater rate : * * * : good seat , sound , and picture] there are mani philosophi as to whi we are so fascin with cartoon . they provid a method of total escap in which anyth will work within their context , from the outrag slapstick of looney tune to the intens of japanim . watch " flubber " realli clinch this idea for me , becaus it just a live action cartoon that present itself as a regular comedi . it prove how pain unfunni all those gag and slapstick would be in realiti , and how import it is to actual have a stori . the film wast no time in establish it lightheart , cartooni atmospher . we meet medfield colleg chemistri professor phillip brainard ( william ) , the typic , suppos likabl mad scientist . within the first 10 minut we get at least a half dozen joke about how forget he is . phillip memori loss seem less like a cartooni gag and more like a real case of alzhiem diseas - isn't this rather lowbrow comedi ? he start teach chemistri after walk in on a nude figur draw class ( an inappropri joke for a kid movi if i ever saw one ) . we learn he has stood his up fiance , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simpli becaus he forgotten . sara claim to love him , but say if he forget the wed again she'll stop love him ( a sign of childish attitud the film deni it has ) . but even cartoon must have conflict to resolv , and it no surpris the major conflict here are relat . christoph mcdonald doe and even wors version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not onli want to steal phillip idea , but his woman too . what wors is that sara actual seem interest in him ! wilson work for a rival colleg that want to buy out medfield , which is go broke , unless phillip can invent someth to save the day . one of the first rule of filmmak is to make sure the titl has someth to do with the film . the flubber is play for gag after it is introduc , but is all but forgotten about thereaft . it obvious phillip is go to accident invent flubber , a fli rubber compound that yield tremend energi , and the promot make the flubber look realist and funni . unfortun , the flubber , like all the special effect in this film , look veri fake and unconvinc . flubber also seem to have intellig and a person , and by the time it perform a song and danc routin , you give up wonder how life could spontan come to an inanim object . most of the film wander aimless as it reli on the flubber to make for the comedi ( sinc phillip absent-minded is forgotten about ) and somehow push the stori along . but it clear how weak this premis is from the get-go and the film just get wors . all the joke involv peopl get hit by fast-mov , flubber-pow object includ : bowl ball ; fli car that don't fli well ; and a basketbal team capabl of jump 100 feet into the air . it all present with complet logic , and no one believ flubber exist even when they see it with their own eye . dure the basketbal scene , the coach for the rival team actual say , " i think they might be cheat , " to which the refere repli , " there no rule about jump too high . " " predict " doesn't begin to describ the motion the film goe through , especi after the halfway point . and it not how terribl contriv the plot is , it the way it broken down scene-by-scen , with absolut no transit . not onli that , but all the actor here , especi william , seem bore to tear . i'd say 80 percent of all the scene were shot with a bluescreen , so it almost forgiv when you realiz they'r talk to noth and interact with noth . it safe to say everyth that could be bad about " flubber " is . the onli origin element the film has is the world first romanc between a machin and a human . but this aspect is quit twist if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won't .
1 an entertain 2 hour await the audienc in this film set in the earli 80 . sevigni and beckinsal play disco chick alic and charlott , who are on the lookout for love . alic is mousi , shi , intellectu , charlott is bitchi , out-go and fun . we join their adventur as they go through a varieti of adventur , and men , all to the background of the local disco . whit stillman has both written and direct an interest and believ stori . alic and charlott are both well written charact , and the actress who play them aren't bad aswel . sevigni deliv an honest perform , and make the audienc feel for her charact . beckinsal play extrem bitch personifi , yet her charact never becom complet unlik . the huge support cast also play a part in make sure this movi is thorough entertain . the dialogu is sharp and well written , with mani funni set piec . for exampl , there a great discuss about ladi & the tramp by the main charact . the disco tune play in the background also make sure that this admit long film is good fun . the direct is good , bring out the drama and comedi in the scene . but their are slight flaw with the movi . first , although it is suppos set in the 80 , the charact are veri , veri 90 . the way they dress and act have a veri 90 feel to them . although the male hairstyl look slight 80 , frank the 80 atmospher just wasn't convey , which is a shame . also , as mention abov , the film is too long , and some part do lag . the charm of the charact do help these moment , but general the edit could of been a bit tighter . the plot also side-track into a silli cocain deal bust , which seem out of place in this movi . final , their are almost too mani charact in the film , and despit the run time , the film never realli spend enough time on them . some of the charact are veri slight , which is a shame . the conclus , while funni , is also surpris weak , and certain not strong enough . but despit these qualm , the last day of disco is a funni , warm movi , which is certain worth see , and is a fit homag to the disco era of the 80 . worth a look . overal rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998 " you know , for kid " - norvill barn
1 here is a film that is so unexpect , so scari , and so origin that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . okay , it isn't quit origin , consid it is a sequel to the box offic hit speci , but it certain is smart . most film of this genr are reminisc of those cheesi b-horror film from the 50s and 60s , and some even becom them . howev , as we learn with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometim expect can be shatter . a lot of critic has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two review ) , and it make me wonder whi these type of film are automat dismiss as gori , laughabl piec of trash . but , the thing is , it isn't . it well made , well act , and quit intellig . i can see most of the critic now complain about the level of gore or the level of sexual in the film . but the speci seri isn't about the lack of these element . it about how much it can get into one film . and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premis that allow it to get away with do so . speci ii begin in the present day , though it seem to be an altern univers . mani film ( especi sci-fi one ) creat similar timelin as our realist one , but chang it to fit the film need . speci ii begin with the arriv of an american spacecraft , the excurs , land on the surfac of mar . aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a veri bright and veri handsom astronaut . patrick is the son of senat ross ( jame cromwel ) , who just want patrick to succeed . well , it would seem that he has succeed . land on the surfac of mar , he is the first human be to ever do so . of cours , he isn't the first ever . about a billion year ago , an alien speci suppos land on mar and destroy the perfect live condit that were abl to sustain life . now , of cours , the red planet is cold and rocki . no life live on it . that is , no visibl life . patrick , upon leav the spacecraft and land on the red soil , collect sampl from the ground . he take them aboard , and put them in storag . unfortun , one of the sampl contain a form of life , and it get loos when it is heat aboard the ship . just prior to head back to earth , this life form creep along the floor and inhabit the earthl . they pass out for approxim seven minut , and then shrug it off as noth , becaus they can't even rememb . they blame it on a technic malfunct . back on earth , patrick begin to have strong urg to mate with as mani women as possibl . as we know from the origin , this is becaus the alien want to breed and take over the planet . howev , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . patrick is realli look for anoth alien to breed with , and he find it in eve ( natasha henstridg ) . eve was clone from dna taken from sil , the origin alien . howev , this time around , most of her " alien " urg have been either decreas dramat , or lie dormant . the project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberg , repris her role from speci ) , and her motiv seem respect . sinc she was involv with the origin alien attack , she want to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . and it has . story-wis , speci ii is much stronger than it predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , alien ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on stori ) . what surpris me the most with this film was the incorpor of histor fact into the screenplay . in my search for extraterrestri intellig cours in colleg , we learn about a piec of rock from mar which land in one of the pole . this piec of rock contain fossil which may have been proof of life on mar ( later , it was proven that it was not a live creatur that creat it ) . the script use this effect , but also manag to provid a well-balanc plot . begin with the first man on mar ( someth i have alway dream of see ) , i was hope that the film would turn this element into a use start point for the movi . and it doe it quit well . the charact are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . the onli charact that seem a littl clich is the general ( georg dzundza ) , and yet , he remain logic in everyth he doe . there are the obvious flaw of cours , most lie in the technic aspect . the special effect are onli mediocr , and some are just plain bad . but for the most part , they remain believ ( i even notic a homag to the alien seri when the mother gave birth to alien children ) . also , the most realist one are usual the goriest , rang from peopl be torn open , or someon head be blown off . howev , some plot element also may elicit laugh from the audienc , includ a menag a troi that is all but necessari . mani peopl dislik the speci seri becaus all it is is an excus for sex , nuditi , and gori violenc . howev , i tend to disagre . what were the alien film about ? and , if an alien speci ever did come to earth , and their sole purpos was to destroy us , wouldn't you mate as quick as possibl with as mani peopl as possibl ? my onli gripe with this is dure the scene where patrick goe search for a mate in a groceri store . i didn't realiz that alien were that picki on choos women to mate with ( i just assum it is his part-human side look for the most beauti one ) . the act is quit good for this kind of film . it is a vast improv over the first film , at least . the act is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lower itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have ask for comparison with film like alien . okay , so it isn't that good . georg dzundza is probabl the most obvious mistak on cast , as his over-the-top imperson of a general make him annoy and distract . natasha henstridg is limit this time around , as she is usual enclos in a cage . howev , she doe manag a veri impress perform with this aspect hinder ani of her talent . oh yeah , and she quit fun to just plain watch . marg helgenberg is immens better this time around , and her perform is probabl the best in this film . michael madsen is so-so , but he isn't annoy , and he soon becom rather appeal ( with his nice cynic person ) . jame cromwel has a small part , but he make it much better than what it could have been with a more incap actor . as i say , ani film with jame cromwel dramat increas in likeabl . mykelti williamson give an enjoy perform , and he give the film a more down-to-earth feel . and , of cours , justin lazard . lazard has so far been ridicul for his perform , but i think he is effect . sure , he is wooden , but isn't that what his charact is like ? the moment when he touch the glass separ henstridg from him was extrem well done , due to the coupl act . speci ii is rate r for strong sexual , sci-fi violence/gor and languag . this is definit an r rate film that young kid should not see . more than like , they would probabl have nightmar and never have sex for the rest of their live . hell , i don't even know if i will . what is sure to be a critic lambast film turn out to be the surpris film of the year . i probabl won't see anoth film where i was expect so littl and got so much for quit a while . director peter medak has craft a veri suspens , and sometim veri scari movi out of a mediocr seri . medak has also master the wonder " jump ! " moment , and has probabl the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . strong act , smart dialogu , intellig plot , and a sure-hand director , speci ii is exact what these film should be : entertain .
0 in the mid-1980 , follow the splendid debut in hugh hudson greystok and relat success of first highland film , it look like christoph lambert act career might go somewher . but , it wasn't meant to be , which becam obvious follow highland ii . in this decad christoph lambert becam associ with film with low budget and even lower qualiti . veri often such film were scienc fiction , which meant that the fan of that genr learn the hard way what to evad anyth star christoph lambert . whether it was becaus of real lack of talent , terribl miscast or simpl bad luck isn't import - the end result was almost alway horribl . the same can be said for fortress , 1993 scienc fiction film direct by stuart gordon , director who creat cult follow with his 1980s horror gorefest like reanim and from beyond . the movi is set in 2018 . for some undisclos reason , usa introduc strict popul control and coupl are bar from have more than one child . jake ( christoph lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by author on the border . sentenc to 31 year in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privat own correct facil , equip with state-of-the-art futurist technolog and run by comput call zed . although equip with gismo that regul everi aspect of inmat live and make ani escap imposs , prison author often use violenc . jake surviv mani ordeal and earn respect of some inmat which would help him when he begin plane the escap . such escap should becom necess , becaus the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begin show unhealthi interest in karen . after rather intrigu begin and some interest special effect that depict the futurist set of prison , this film soon start sink into mediocr . the reason is in the screenplay that quick degener into whole seri of prison movi clich ? s and situat that are pain predict . by the time brennick begin his escap from fortress , those situat not onli begin to look predict , but utter implaus too . of cours , film never tri to explain whi the countri that lack resourc to support it present popul happen to spend bucketload of money on ultra-expens supertechnolog with sole intent of keep aliv most useless and danger member of the societi . the initi interest plot is done even more wrong by stereotyp charact , play by not too interest or talent actor . lori laughlin , although physic attract , show the act abil of sequoia . kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspir , capabl of solid , yet forgett perform . lambert perform is also good , but even the bigger talent couldn't help this film , destin to end in oblivion .

" howev , be that music of the heart is base on a true stori and that moviereview . org feel the film can not be proper credit without such revel , plot giveaway will appear in the follow review . if this bother you , pleas note the 3 star rate of the film and stop read now . " what doe it take to play carnegi hall ? practic . " it take two hour for music of the heart to " play carnegi hall , " both figur and liter . like the children it portray , the movi start from the dark realm of aw cinema and work it way up to a show-stop perform at the legendari concert hall . roberta guaspari ( academi award winner meryl streep ) has two kid , a husband who left her and 50 violin she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean . her life desper need a jump start and get one when she meet a man who introduc her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementari school . she soon find her job is on the rock as the men in her life continu to rotat through revolv door . that is the pattern-lik plot of this product . ultim , the film choos a zero-sum answer to these problem and find her music career at an all-tim high when the men in her life final vanish . the first hour of music of the heart is rather pain . roberta charact lack develop and consequ seem to be flat . also lack depth is the film " bad guy , " a narrow-mind music teacher ( josh pai ) who reject roberta out of principl ( the movi never explain exact which principl that is ) and conveni come and goe from the plot accord to when it might be dramat to have a villain around . the next 15 minut of the film are mediocr . they are highlight by one child return to roberta class ( come after the great old hollywood scene where he explain be can't be around anymor becaus " my mom said . . . " ) and a glow concert . not know the run time , you may expect the credit to role at this point . but they don't . instead the film use the next 45 minut to finish it journey from bad to mediocr to excel . director wes craven , known for his work of horror , use some old sentiment trick to get the audienc tear . one romant break up scene is highlight by the classic " but . . . last night . . . " and roberta two children also have textbook conflict with their singl mother regard their father absenc . the citi of harlem play a strong role in the movi . roberta mother is initi reluct to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film doe noth to combat that stereotyp . the nois track for these scene are domin by siren ; predict one of roberta student is gun down and kill off screen . one thing the film doe lack is subtleti . the fact that a littl boy was play " we shall overcom " on his violin after the aforement shoot was a cute and discreet refer . the fact that the entir orchestra begin to play it over and over soon after is an overdon refer that show how littl credit he give the audienc . ( of cours , in horror film the foreshadow and between-the-lin moment are meant to be overdon , so perhap he too is just learn to play the game . ) even with all it flaw , music of the heart is a beauti film . that is not an excus for the movi poor begin . but as i watch the scene in carnegi hall , i thought of some of the great act that have taken that stage . in decemb of 1979 a comedian name andi kaufman put on a show that will forev be rememb as one of the most origin in theatr histori . the perform includ a dead-on elvi impress , robin william in disguis and a moment at the end when kaufman announc he would take the whole audienc out for milk and cooki . so , how did this comic genius choos to open the show of his life ? he had a charact name toni clifton take the stage for the sole purpos of irrit and anger the audienc . perhap it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusti becaus just as kaufman had santa favorit food , this movi has an amaz final .
1 it is alway refresh to see a superstar actor who get paid more than enough to forget about work for a live to want to take a chanc and play a less-than-savouri charact as mel gibson doe in payback . of cours , if i was be paid $25 million for one month work , i'd probabl be will to take risk as well , but that neither here nor there . payback is base on a novel by richard stark ( appar actual donald e . westlak , author of the grifter , itself a fine crime film ) which was also film in the 1960s as point blank star one of the toughest of tough guy , lee marvin . the film open with gibson have recov from be shot sever time in the back , by whom we don't know yet . all we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't a happi chappi and is hellbent on get the money stolen from him back , and get even in the process , no matter what the consequ . it turn out that the man he after is val ( gregg henri ) , his sometim partner with whom he stole a briefcas full of cash from a gang of chines mobster . obvious not have much of a crisi of the soul , val figur porter is dead and goe about use his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employ . porter , howev , is the sort of man who hold a grudg and onc on his feet , goe about exact reveng on the double-cross val . gibson give a terrif perform in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slight unhing guy who doesn't mind beat up or shoot peopl to get what he want . you probabl wouldn't see other actor in his salari rang take such an offbeat , out-of-charact role such as porter ( jim carrey won't be do anyth like this in a hurri after what happen the last time he tri - the cabl guy , anyon ? ) . harrison ford idea of play an unsympathet charact is presum innoc ; the last time schwarzenegg play a villain was batman and robin , which we won't mention further ; and has stallon ever realli play a villain at all ? this is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . while he isn't the sort of charact you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of , he noth compar to some of the one we are forc to watch in countless bad thriller and action film where they kill innoc peopl in the blink of an eye or execut their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are . porter is onli tri to get back what is not-so-right his , which in a way is almost understand . payback is an enjoy dramat black comedy-thril which won't be rememb as be among gibson most import work , but is still one of the finer film he done . the onli real problem with it is that , while everyth seem to work out in the end , i was left feel someth was lack ; was that all ? the end look as if it was tack on at the last minut , and the final voice-ov doesn't ring true , even though it was use to good effect elsewher in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodi . the film just end far too sudden , after a huge build-up in the penultim scene . a fine film , even though it need just a littl someth more to be the kind of a film that can be recommend without hesit . just be readi for a possibl letdown of an end .
1 if beavi and butthead had a favorit movi , from dusk till dawn would probabl be it . script by quentin tarantino and direct by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) , the movi pander to the veri worst in sex and violenc -- and is incred fun to watch . it start off as a pulp fiction-typ crime stori , with crimin brother georg clooney and tarantino rob a conveni store . becaus this is a tarantino movi , howev , it not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot , it a case of a hole be shot through someon hand , a man on fire jump out behind the counter and the entir store blow up as they drive away . the open scene set the tone for the rest of the movi -- everyth overdon and noth as it seem . clooney and tarantino bring a hostag to the motel and then hijack an rv with a famili in it . harvey keitel play the backslidden ex-preach and juliett lewi his daughter , whom regist sex-pervert tarantino eye endless . you know you'r mental unbalanc when you find lewi the least bit attract , although she not near as obnoxi as usual in from dusk till dawn . the first half of the movi has the crimin and hostag tri to get to and through the mexico border , clooney strategi involv hide in the rv shower while lewi is on the toilet . it doe it trick ; the border guard take one look at lewi reliev herself and immedi goe blind , never notic clooney or tarantino . onc they get to mexico , it time to wait at the rendezv point , a topless bar call titti twister where we'r onc again remind tarantino wrote the movi as he drink champagn off the foot of a stripper . final , after about ten minut of intercut boob shot and clooney forc keitel and lewi to drink with him , the stripper turn into a vampir . soon half the peopl in the bar are vampir and the other half fall or fight back . that right , we'v come all this way to see a vampir movi . but like everyth els , tarantino take this age-old genr and twist it to his own end to produc over-the-top entertain . so we get holi water condom balloon , head roll , quadrupl impal on an overturn tabl and keitel get bitten by a vampir and announc he onli has a few minut left befor he becom " a lap dog of satan . " the from dusk till dawn dialogu is 100% tarantino , hover between absurd and disgust ( as when they'r enter the nightclub and cheech marin announc the main attract of the titti twister ) , but alway entertain , and is a huge reason the movi is so much fun to watch instead of be one more second-r gorefest . clooney , keitel and especi tarantino are so over-the-top with their deliveri that the dialogu is that much more hilari , ensur not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit serious . stuff like this would be terribl in ani other movi , but tarantino and rodriguez know exact what to do to entertain peopl , even if there absolut no messag or mean to from dusk till dawn . pulp fiction had the vulgar and violenc for a reason , but this movi just throw it out for cheap entertain . from dusk till dawn isn't the classic of modern cinema that pf is , but is doe prove you can do a good job make a realli bad movi .
0 nostalgia for the 70s continu , as we see a reviv of one of the decad greatest achiev : the marijuana comedi . howev half bake doesn't quit run with all it brain cell , and will make you appreci the question talent of cheech and chong all the more . the plot follow the misadventur of four ne'er-do-wel stoner . there the group unoffici leader , thurgood ( david chappell ) , scarfac ( guillermo diaz ) , brian ( jim breuer ) , and kenni ( harland william ) . kenni get into troubl , when , while on a munchi run , feed his snack food to a diabet polic hors . when the anim keel over , he find himself accus of kill a polic offic , and face a $1 , 000 , 000 bail . his friend promis to rais money for a 10% bail bond , but have no idea how . that is , until thurgood stumbl upon a stash of pharmaceut marijuana be test at the compani where he work as a janitor . soon the three guy are deal dope to rais fund , while avoid the cop and rival dealer sampson simpson ( clarenc william iii ) . for a comedi , the film is pretti humorless . not that it doesn't tri . . . it just that the comic setup are obvious and the payoff near all fall flat . the four lead are near all play the same charact . onli william stand out ( while still perform on the level of his humor-fre comedi rocket man ) , but that is becaus he imprison throughout most of the film , give a much need chang of pace ( but most swap one set of obvious gag for anoth ) . to help out , the film is pack full of cameo . steven wright , tommi chong , janean garofalo , willi nelson , snoop doggi dogg , and jon stewart all make appear at one point or anoth . none of them work , beyond the simpl " hey , that _____ " level . in fact the funniest work in the film come from chappell . not as his bland pothead lead , but in his second role , as a pot-obsess rapper , sir smokealot . grant , it pretti much a one-jok role , and there aren't a ton of laugh . . . but this film need everi one it can scrape up . to top it off , and in a move contrast with the tone of the rest of the film , thurgood is given a love interest , mari jane ( rachel true ) . her role is that of the public servic announc : to inform us whi do drug ( includ pot ) is wrong . her charact seem fabric mere as a defens to the " your film promot the use of drug " camp . the film would have been better off by stick with the " rebel " tone it so eager tri to claim . yet , in the end , it doesn't realli matter . watch the film clean and sober , you are bound to recogn how truli aw it is .
0 i rememb realli enjoy this movi when i saw it year ago . i guess my memori realli suck . there is veri , veri littl that is funni in caddyshack . the laugh are few , and far between , and what there are realli aren't that great . caddyshack , as the name impli , more or less center on one young caddi work at an exclus countri club . michael o'keef play said caddi . whi they cast this unknown , fair untal actor in the lead role is complet beyond me . the movi doesn't seem to have a real plot , just a seri of scene that are littl more than opportun for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera . the onli real stori , if you can call it that , was a subplot involv the mental disturb green keeper , bill murray , who is have his own privat littl war against a gopher who is ruin the cours . most of the margin laugh come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mug and overact for the camera -- with pain limit success . bill murray is slight amus in place , but fair wast . the biggest wast of all is chevi chase , who didn't even crack a smile on my face with his charact lame zen-lik approach to golf . there are a few decent scene involv the interact between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequ to carri the movi . i guess that what you get for base a stori around an unknown kid . i'm not sure what the writer of this thing were think of , but i realli think it was someth far remov from comedi as they were put pen to paper . noth about this movi work . it wouldn't have taken a genius to figur out that this thing wasn't go to fli . most of the scene just couldn't possibl be funni . it as if the writer where off in their own littl brain damag world . i'm sure scene involv chevi chase and his one with the golf ball were suppos to be funni . in realiti , they were pain embarrass to watch . there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddi go wild for the " hot babe " of the movi walk by in her bikini . oliv oil would have fill out this swimsuit better than this girl . everyth about this movi was just complet implaus as far as the comedi was concern . mayb if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illeg narcot this thing might be funni . but for the rest of us , stay the hell away from caddyshack .
1 notic : this is a review and analysi of exotica . the first part of this piec is the review , the second part contain some analysi of the movi which might be constru as spoiler . if you have not seen the movi and after read the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discuss afterward . star : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elia kostea , don mckellar , arsine khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan exotica is a film that grow on retrospect . exotica keep the viewer guess about the relationship between the various charact in the film . all of the peopl know each other , but apart from that , there seem to be no other reason whi to select such set and follow them in this fiction account . the director hint for possibl solut , use a multi-lin plot , so popular with critic in mysteri train , and use to good advantag by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . exotica reach a whole new dimens use this techniqu . at the end it is surpris to see how well the piec of the puzzl fit togeth , in spite their appar unconnected and even mislead featur . the out-of-chronological-ord techniqu has becom ever so popular , perhap even de rigueur , for biograph film . similar , we can now expect to see more movi in the futur which will use , to vari extent , converg multiplot . on a first glanc , onc the multi-plot puzzl in exotica is solv , there seem to be littl left to look at . but percept mind which take the time to dig further will be reward with interest view on life or rather , commentari on view of life . exotica is veri much worth see . it open to critic prais worldwid ( i first saw it in mexico citi , last decemb ) . in canada , it broke record for a movi of it kind , which prompt the american distributor to go for a wide releas . apart from a strong plot , act is veri convinc , and the soundtrack seem as if made for the movi . the spoon-fed-entertain crowd may not appreci this movi , and thus it might last littl on screen . but if you want to tri a movi a cut abov the crowd , with an origin that is ever so rare , by all mean see exotica . analysi ( * * spoiler * * ahead ) what is behind the complex plot in exotica ? first , a common theme of the quest for gratif by monetari mean . the lone tax-auditor , the repress homosexu pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which run the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodel , the audienc at the movi theatr , all use person wealth to buy palliat relief for the penuri of the soul . . . . then we have the quest for gratif through visual mean by most of the same peopl , includ those who sit watch exotica . . . . in that regard exotica stand for onlook at a nightclub , for the rich man look through silver mirror , and poor-rich peopl look at other peopl live through a silver screen . exotica also stand for unwant societi attent into the live of other peopl , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . exotica is the custom agent look at the pet shop owner , which in turn is look at the core of the problem between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detach eye of a gay person ( no attract to the strip dancer ) , and onli interest on avoid jail ( no person relationship with the tax auditor ) . in exotica everybodi is watch , and what is wors , everybodi know . second , exotica is about isol peopl hold back their feel ; about peopl which by voluntari or involuntari mean transfer their view of realiti to other charact . the strip dancer becom the proverbi daughter , the dj becom the proverbi killer by mean of break the relationship between the father and the proverbi daughter . the niec becom the babi sitter , the babi sitter becom the dancer , and the dancer becom the proverbi daughter . the pet shop owner becom the proverbi dj , by find the proverbi daughter . a chain made of real and imagin link come around full circl , just as everyth come around to a fit whole at the end of the movi .
0 note : some may consid portion of the follow text to be spoiler . be forewarn . at the end of the day , those reflect upon the debacl that is the aveng would do well to take note that warn cloud loom on the horizon for the project well befor warner bros . made the contenti decis to abandon preview press screen and scrap plan for a gala premier . this highly-anticip film rendit of the cult televis show was origin slot for an earli june open , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studio heavi hitter ; it eventu demot to a less potent mid-august open was an obvious earli indic of the studio lack of confid with the pictur . and with good reason . this is a joyless exercis of a film , held togeth by a bare coher plot and lack ani semblanc of excit , thrill or wit . remark in it banal and brutal uninvolv , the aveng is a catastroph mess which immedi invit comparison to last year case studi in style over substanc , joel schumach much-loath batman & robin . ( inde , both film even featur appal , ridicul sequenc which find central charact dress up in fuzzi overs costum . ) uma thurman , who take on the salaci role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chop emma peel immort by diana rigg , was the onli bright spot in the aforement schumach disast , imbu her poison ivi with a dose of sassi and sli wit that gave audienc someth to smile at amidst the cinemat carnag . unfortun , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fienn ( our new john steed , take over for patrick macne ) demonstr no appreci chemistri whatsoev , fatal crippl the pictur as they volley fizzl reparte back and forth and trade double-entendr with all the enthusiasm of two actor pain awar that they'r on board a sink ship . at this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fienn may never make the transit from arthous apollo to mainstream lead man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commend seedi perform in the regrettably-neglect kathyrn bigelow film strang day . the duo * look * the part -- and admit the aveng is , more than most , heavili depend upon style -- but they'r no fun to watch , and i found myself grow increas distant and annoy by the lack of spark between the two cheekili iron charact as they navig through the pictur caper-esqu plot . when not check my wristwatch or shift restless in my seat , i began to allevi the boredom by consid how this all might have play out had the filmmak chose to go instead with that erstwhil emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsal ( although the notion now intrigu me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was origin in the run for the part and can verit handl a spot-on english accent . if noth els , it'd at least be high entertain for the incongru sight of the vagu twiggish young actress kick butt . the stori , such as it is , involv the ever-bemus tandem of steed and peel combat the malevol sir august de wynter ( sean conneri ) , an eccentr aristocrat threaten the safeti of the nation with his climate-control contrapt . ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) overlook some goofi clone nonsens and quirki hijinx involv our protagonist superior , it sound far better than it play , and is render almost indecipher by blatant post-product tinker ; it clear evid that the pictur has been cut to shred . the aveng was never about grip drama , and our hero accord never take villain sir august veri serious , but given the lack of cohes in the plot and the lack of menac convey by the buffoonish maniac , it all decid uncompel . mr . conneri , who onscreen bare long enough to regist an impress , approach the role like a man fulfil a contractu oblig , simultan chew the sceneri while unabl to hide his disinterest . at least it all look good . this is a genuin handsom product , with fine costum design by anthoni powel and crispli shot by roger pratt . in particular , the gleam product design by stuart craig command attent , adept draw element both old and new in order to depict this great britain . there are a hand of strike visual moment in the film , includ an attack by a swarm of giant robot bee and a nice shot of steed and peel find a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremit dull that even these instanc fail to stir interest or rais puls rate . by the time the film climax had arriv , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slug it out amidst crash wave and thunder rain , but with the quickest escap rout from the theatr . not coincident , the entic bit of visual bravura were the shot assembl into the movi remark trailer , a savvi piec of work which iron is infinit more appeal that the featur film itself ; the first promo which made the round in earli spring is probabl my favourit studio trailer so far this year . it everyth that the aveng is not -- sauci , clever , engag , and entertain . a crush disappoint , the film is one of the worst outing of the year -- too drearili aw to be savour as gleefulli bad , too polish to overlook it defici . there may be upcom pictur that are even more lifeless than the aveng , but i sure hope not .
1 this is the movi not the perfum . a slow move , stylish psycholog thriller in imit of hitchcock vertigo . it is adapt from an origin stori by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is direct by de palma and script by schrader . set in new orlean , 1959 , it show the wealthi michael courtland ( cliff robertson ) sit on top of the world , celebr his tenth wed anniversari with a parti in his mansion , as his love wife elizabeth ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and young daughter ami ( blackman ) , both look up to him beam with joy . his real-est develop partner bob la sall ( john lithgow ) propos a toast to him and to their prosper busi , while his high societi friend give him their best wish . upon retir for the night , his daughter and wife are kidnap in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliv $500 , 000 tomorrow or they will be kill . inspector brie ( stanley rey ) come up with a plan to put in phoni money and a transmitt in the briefcas exchang , as that will lead them to the kidnapp . but the kidnapp burst out of the hous surround by the polic , take the two victim with them and in the pursu polic chase , the kidnapp car explod and goe over the bridg , where none of the bodi were found . griev the loss of his wife and child , the guilt-ridden michael build them a tomb on the expens land they were to develop . sixteen year later he goe with his partner bob on a vacat and he revisit florenc , itali , where he met his wife . when he goe to the church where they met , he see a young girl who look exact like his wife . her name is sandra portinari ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and she work there restor art that is decay . he fall instant in love with her and doesn't heed bob warn that she might be a gold digger and decid to take her back to new orlean and marri her . sandra becom his second chanc to prove his love , as he think he can final put the past behind him . the surpris to come weren't realli all that surpris , as the beauti in the storytel is almost exclus in the underst act by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emot impact perform by genevi ? ve bujold , and the compet act of john lithgow . it play too much like a rehash of the master work , to break ani new ground , yet it is still thrill in it own way .
0 man , this was one wierd movi . similar to conspiraci theori in that it couldn't decid which genr it is . the first hour is your standard stock alien clone , which nice creat an eeri atmospher about the ship . the last half hour ? this was when the maker blew the script out the airlock and just decid - " screw it , let just kill everybodi " . from then on - forget sci-fi . . . this movi becom 100% horror . what realli dissappoint me about this movi was that it tri to scare you in entir the wrong way . instead of use clever trick or tri to build up to a scare - this movi just use loud nois , sudden camera shift and short quick burst of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyon seen it all befor and know when to expect it . the one thing that was done well was the lead up to find out about what happen to the previous crew . there are skeleton lie around mangl and mash , but what did this ? then final after be pain restor - the new crew view the video . the act isn't too bad at all . . . . . consid what the actor had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interest dialogu to speak of . there was some veri nice camerawork in certain sequenc though , like when the hull near the bridg of the event horizon is breach and the camera pan back to follow specif object as they bounc across the deck and are suck out into space . this movi could have been so much better . it had a good experienc cast who deserv more to work with . there was just noth new here that ani of us haven't seen befor in alien or hellrais .
1 if you thought baz luhrmann radic take on _william_shakespeare's_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild , wait until what you see what toni award-win stage director juli taymor ( _the_lion_k : _the_broadway_musical_ ) doe to the bard _titus_andronicus_ for her audacious--and veri bloody--film debut . while luhrmann transplant the star-cross lover to 1990s florida , taymor keep this grisli tale of reveng in rome--but place it in a surreal tempor limbo . the colosseum suggest the proper time of imperi rome , but high rise and heavi duti kitchen oven suggest the 1990s , while the vintag automobil and some costum are more 40s and 50s , and other garment are more gladiator-lik . as tamora , queen of goth ( jessica lang ) exact reveng on roman general titus ( anthoni hopkin ) for kill her eldest son , and he doe the same to her for the wrong she commit , taymor obvious want to express the timeless relev of the stori under theme . howev , the time converg approach onli work at time , for often it just distract , as in one scene where tamora suviv son ( matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyer ) blow off steam play video arcad game . taymor didn't have to resort to such avant gard time trick , for the stori would have reson just as strong had she jettison them . she is a strong storytel and a master visual stylist , the latter compliment encompass all area , makeup and costum choic as well as those in the edit and photographi depart . she also has a sure way with actor ; hopkin titus is at onc tragic and horrifi , and lang is sultri as the viper tamora . the clear standout of the cast , howev , is harri lennix as aaron , a moor who is tamora secret lover and a schemer in his own right . lennix bring great depth to a role that could have easili been play as a stock villain . a great villain he inde is , but to leav it at that isn't give full justic to his power and multi-dimension work . _titus_ isn't a complet success , but it is never less than fascin , and it announc the arriv of a fearless imagin new cinemat voic .
0 summer movi are , by natur , dumb affair that are usual made for some quick enjoy and to make money . wild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follow much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoy than most summer movi . will smith play jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglass . he is call by presid grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out whi top govern scientist are disappear . west is pair up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the miss scientist to a legless mastermind , name dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zani moustach . ) befor i pile on with the mani negat in this sorri affair , i'll give it a chanc with the posit . there a nice credit sequenc , the product design by bo welch is pleas to the eye , and the special effect are decent enough . there also a pleasant soundtrack . buri deep in the dross are one or two amus joke . and salma hayek pop up as the femal interest , which is alway nice to see . apart from these factor , though , noth els in wild wild west work . first , there littl chemistri between smith and kline , who appear to be in it pure for the money . one would expect zinger pass between the two : none aris . both of them plod through the below standard plot , know that there is a pay chequ wait at the end . not even kenneth branagh provid much entertain : although he is over the top , the materi doesn't present much opportun for branagh to be truli crazi . therefor , he just come across as loud as obnoxi . the onli enjoy perform come from the sexi salma hayek , who is given so littl screen time it embarrass . she appear to be in the film to mere show off her bodi , and be ogl at by kline and smith . her charact also chang at a whim to fit the mechan of the script , and there is no sens of realism about the charact . the humour in the film is also veri off . will smith put a littl spin to his daft line in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display . the script larg boil down to insult that aren't veri funni , and one-lin that bare rais a smirk . it also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west tri to wisecrack his way out of a lynch , and actual say slaveri is good to save himself . it not a funni scene , and the whole thing come off rather uncomfort . the film also make the tragic mistak that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automat unfunni , it isn't , but the wild wild west make this joke even more pain to watch through pure inept . there also problem with the plot . jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kind of sticki situat , but the way they get out of them are alway unsatisfi , and reli pure on luck , rather than audienc pleas skill . plot element are introduc into the film , and then thrown away just as quick . the main piec of the stori , a 80 foot mechan , steam driven spider devis by loveless look rather impress , but there no particular reason whi it should be built . whi not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungain , fragil piec of machineri that just beg to be blown up ? director barri sonnenfeld alway has a breezi look to them , with some nice camera trick , but even this is miss from this stilt affair . wild wild west could have benefit from sonnenfeld whack out style of direct , but not much of it is evid , make this film drag out even more . it a sad thing when _four_ ( credit ) screenwrit , a talent director and a will star can't make a film work , and eventu wild wild west collaps under it sexist , mild racist , unfunni weight .

0 pre-review note : see as the onli concern of bodi shot is " sex " , i will be forc to refer to that particular act innumer time throughout the durat of this review . becaus of this , i will tri to vari word descript of " sex " ( mean if you are offend by pejor term , and \ or your name is jerri falwel , you are kind invit to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happen to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it most like just anoth way of refer to " sex " . i think we'd all agre that ani word use incess becom a bit monoton so i hope you appreci my attempt to liven up what could potenti be a veri bore review . though not as bore as the movi which make steve forb flat tax plan seem as live as watch a nake mathew mconaughi play the bongo while high on god know what . bodi shot is a film so frighten of coitus that scene of copul are film omin , in the way you'd normal expect to see a violent attack . it about peopl who think about screw , seek it out , and talk about it . these are thing we all do , sometim . the charact in this film spend everi wake moment ponder the simplic of sexual act . their live center around the next sexual encount , but they seem depress . it as if fuck is all they have to look forward to after a busi workweek . at it core bodi shot is a messag movi , the kind of thing i could pictur realli progress church group show to middl schooler in order to turn them off coition . michael cristoff ( who direct gia , anoth film that treat bump ug as if it where evil ) is a moralist with noth new to say . his charact don't communic anyth of interest to each other , so cristoff give them an opportun to let out their inner thought by speak direct into the camera . they voic simplist platitud like " i like to come " or " sex without love equal violenc " . huh ? and yes that is as complex as this movi observ get . the charact are stupid and shallow , with not one regist as anyth more . the plot concern vapid over sex twentysometh on an all night hunt for carnal pleasur , then the after math ( the morn after ) of such event . we meet the charact as they speak direct to us , confid in us with their idiot rumin on intimaci . i would normal go into the charact and the actor who play them , give you the pros and con , but for this film i cannot . i'm not tri to be clever or witti , but i honest hard rememb anyth that would set them apart from the other . with the except of trent ( play by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breast , defin ab , pear white teeth , and creami , flawless skin . i vagu recal brad row as the sensit one , onli becaus his charact get the worst line ( " sex without love equal violenc " ) . in between all the confession , cristoff film everyth like a headach commerci , with blurri slo mos and dramat head turn . the fact that this director at one point won a pulitz prize complet baffl me . this film is made without one iota of intellig or insight into the generat that it tag line claim to be defin . if bodi shot is meant to say that all twentysometyh are idiot and f * * k-obsess , fine , i don't have ani problem with a film that tri to persuad me to think a certain way , but cristoff onli give us one side . addit that one side isn't even entertain ; the charact indulg in buggeri without an ounc of sexi . or realism . one sexual encount take place outsid a club on a chain link fenc between the two most sensit charact . they sudden have vigor intercours with each other for no appar reason ( other than that they both happen to be stand next to each other ? ? ? ala , if it could onli be that easi ? ? ? kid of cours ) , then , not onli isn't it erot , it isn't real . it doesn't feel like an authent sexual encount . everi f * * k scene in this film ( and there are mani ) is treat in the same unsexi manner . bodi shot make fornic dirtier than the most scummi porno film . it show us none of the pleasur that should go along with it , and most of all , it fail to show us whi it charact love make it so much if they seem to hate the act of actual do it . the result search for nooki ( and you can take that cooki ? ? ? ) over one night leav us with sever tedious plot line to follow . the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occur . the film show us two separ version of the possibl rape ( one where it is consensu the other where it is not ) and in both version the young actress play the possibl victim get her shirt torn off . this is a topic that could be interest explor if done intellig , and if memori serv me i can't think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accus which may be one of the most overr movi of the 80 next to wall street . unfortun nobodi give us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actor near all of whom seem to have wander off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . paul thoma anderson approach boogi night in a manner similar to what cristoff doe here , though boogi night succeed . it was similar moralist , but it gave us two differ viewpoint ; it show us how the lifestyl of porn entic it charact , and it show us the possibl fall-out of such a decis . the charact in boogi night were as idiot as the charact are here , but anderson seem to care about them . he gave them heart . cristoff give them noth but rage hormon . he preach to us , by use his charact to preach to us . this is not the way to get ani messag across . whi not just direct a public servic announc on the peril of hittin skin ? cristof kind of doe that , though without an ounc of insight , and with a help of leer exploit .
1 i was origin go to give the spanish prison two and half star . from my first view , i notic that david mamet film was intens and clever at time but bore and clich at other time especi at the begin . from my second view howev , i notic that mamet script was actual a masterpiec . the spanish prison , like the usual suspect or chinatown , beg for the viewer complet attent . miss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the mean of the entir film . also like the aforement film , it reward it viewer for pay attent by deliv a surpris and memor end . mamet is success do again what he onc tackl in 1987 when he wrote and direct hous of game . like his past gem , the spanish prison fool the audienc as much ( or even more ) than the victim . becaus we were deceiv just like the victim , we feel a strong attach to the main charact and consequ are more interest in the film . mamet has the talent of not complet end a film gift wrap , but rather leav some ambigu toward the end . the power that he has in forc the viewer to determin who the good guy and bad guy are onc the film is over , without give a right answer , is uniqu and ingeni . the spanish prison will leav you serious puzzl and intrigu . after see the film again , i notic that the detail mamet use are so incred accur it is frighten . his direct is veri subtl ; as he leav so mani clue explain what is go on and who is who but it is still veri difficult to tell what exact is happen even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . the stori follow a young up and come businessman , joe ross , ( campbel scott ) who has just creat a mysteri and lucrat " process " that everyon is tri to get their hand on . soon ross doe not know who he can trust or who is after his " process . " through his journey ross meet a number of mysteri charact : the rich and popular jimmi dell , a secretari who has a huge crush on ross , and ross boss mr . klein . play by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respect , the support cast is veri solid especi martin , who deserv an oscar nomin for his command and manipul role . the most interest charact in the film , though , was campbel scott joe ross . the charact transform from an ingenu and polit rooki to a paranoid veteran is veri appar and justifi . david mamet script is so interest becaus we know peopl don't actual talk like the charact in the film , yet we feel so connect to some of them . his beguil style could fool ani viewer up for the challeng . this is a must see , for those interest in solv a complex puzzl of a movi .
0 at first glanc , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promis . it plotlin goe like this : the evil king cromwel , desir to take over the world , resurrect an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power . he attack the kingdom of eh-dan and kill young princ talon parent . given a triple-blad sword ( which can shoot bad guy , like a gun ) by his die father , talon vow for reveng . eleven year later , when he establish his own armi , the mercaneri , he vow to take back his kingdom . along the way , he meet up with alana , whose villag is attack by drunken guard and her brother is kidnap by cromwel . talon vow to help , and , after a seri of minor escapad , eventu end up rescu alana brother ( and sever other prison ) , onli to be captur himself ( in other word , put on a cross to be crucifi ! ) . fortun he free himself , rescu alana from marri cromwel , defeat xusia , and then cromwel , all with his tripl blade sword ( dure the final battl , the blade break , but talon finish cromwel off by use a hidden dagger in the blade ) . then , everyth end happili . unfortun , the sword and the sorcer is not even half as good as it sound . what would have been a great film is complet destroy by uneven plot jump , bad act , and gruesom gori , bloodi scene . never onc doe the stori seem to connect togeth , it just jump around repeat . this problem is extrem notic in the open scene where cromwel resurrect xusia . after tell him that he need his help , he lead the warlock out into daylight , but then stab him and send him careen off a cliff afterward . wait a minut , didn't the plotlin say that he need the help of xusia in order to invad eh-dan , which he cannot do by militari forc ? if that is the case , whi doe he dispos of xusia after resurrect him ? and whi doe he manag to take over eh-dan anyway ? these question are just never - no , never - answer in the film . anoth exampl is that one moment we see talon fight for his life , anoth moment we see him just about to be crucifi dure alana wed to cromwel ( ! ) , and final at the end , instead of settl down with alana , he just tell her to " wait " , and then he just ride off ! in addit to the extrem bloodi scene , this uneven plot jump complet destroy what would have been a great fantasi adventur . even some attempt to make it excit , a few fire scene , battl scene , don't work . it just complet fail altogeth miser . the onli good thing about this film is it music score , contribut by david whittak , who had an ( extrem ) short music compos career . the score is boomi and adventur , power , and a billion time better than this film is . my suggest : steer the hell away from this bloodi mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) . iron , though , befor the film credit roll , there is a messag indic that a sequel , tale of the ancient empir , would follow . to my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into product , becaus the sword and the sorcer laid an egg at the box offic , gross onli $39 million . critic were right on in slam the sword and the sorcer , all right . leonard maltin right call it " second rate in script , and act " and at-a-gl film review call it " a confus , stupid , unimagin , unengag , bloodfil bore " . i total agre with these review , all right , and i hope that this piec of #$% ! will be forgotten about . there are far better fantasi movi than the sword and the sorcer . i hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laugh . in fact , my insult don't even come close to the gruesom sick that this film gave me throughout it 100 minut run time .
1 it is with hesit that i call " apocalyps now " a masterpiec . certain , it had the pedigre to be one of the greatest film ever made , with a director known for produc masterpiec with eas , and some of the finest actor of the 1970 . the plot , an adapt of joseph conrad " heart of dark " , was set in vietnam , and the time of the film was suppos to be brilliant , come on the heel of the end of the war . " apocalyps " certain has it moment , some of which are the finest in film histori . the plot is fair simpl . captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubl soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duti . his mission is simpl : take a boat up to cambodian territori , and destroy the command of renegad colonel kurtz ( brando ) " with extrem prejudic " . along the way , willard run into a seri of adventur , includ one with lt . col . kilgor ( duval ) , and a strang encount with playboy bunni . willard s four person crew final make it to kurtz compound , where he discov kurtz has set himself up as a god among the nativ . willard experi with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confront and eventu end . the movi is visual breathtak . the battl scene are exquisit done , and the score is brilliant , set a murki mood of dark that is first-rat . the collag of disturb imag that coppola present is at time both astonish and sicken . the vast amount of detail pour into everi war scene is stun , and there are mani episod that are deepli power which reson through the entir movi . the journey to kurtz camp is quit a ride , with psychosi set in on almost everi charact . the most interest one is kilgor , the lt . col . who care more about the surf than about the mission . it is at time revolt , psychot , and incred , and it is one hell of a movi . the scene are bold , invent , and power , and the act is stun , especi be sheen , duval , and fishburn . the narrat is exquisit , as is the mysteri of kurtz . coppola set about a hallucinatori ride through vietnam , kind of like " save privat ryan " on lsd . the film is jar in it implic , and psychot in it execut . the problem come when the film slow down . one of the major scene in the film , where the boat arriv at the final armi checkpoint befor they start their search for kurtz , is a coloss mess . the dialogu is confus , the light is atroci , and the scene drag on for 10 terribl minut of film . the true problem happen after the crew doe come into the kurtz compound . the film slow down to a drag . sheen seem forev captur by a madman , play by brando is a lazi perform that is not deserv of the accolad it receiv . brando is in the film for no more than 15 minut , but is bath in shadow the entir time , make the last half hour of the film visual pathet . the scene are poor done , the dialogu is muffl , and the whole mess is utter confus beyond all belief . sheen seem to ador this man , but whi the viewer are never told . the entir journey is suppos to be a prelud for a stun entranc of this god-lik kurtz , but the scene fall way short of expect . grant , it has it moment , which are brutal horrif , but the general feel is one of confus . brando mumbl his line in a incoher stir , and my feel was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspir hundr to follow him , so whi do they do it ? there are moment of brillianc , but the visual confus dilut the power of the scene . there are too mani question left unansw with the charact of kurtz to have a satisfi end . the finest scene at the end is sheen escap , and his entrac into the templ . his rise out of the water , with the smoke come off of his slick head , is a brilliant 30 second of film . yet , you cannot shake the feel that there is so much more this film could have done . the psychot ride is unforgett at time , and inde the film on the whole is veri good . it is a stun flaw express of film , for it address major issu , such as man mental stamina dure bout of war . but one still cannot shake the feel that this film could have so much more power , had the charact of kurtz been more explor , and had sheen truli succumb to the fate that the viewer thought he was destin for . there is too much good materi in here not to be call a masterpiec , but it could have been so much more reward .
0 a life less ordinari ( r ) while the extrem peculiar a life less ordinari doe live up to it titl , a more appropri monik would be a movi more misguid , for this confus , confus attempt at romant comedi is a most disarm disast from the talent trainspot team of director danni boyl , produc andrew macdonald , and screenwrit john hodg . at the core of this strang film is a fair basic--and , yes , ordinary--premis . after robert ( boyl regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspir writer of trashi novel , is fire from his janitori job at the navill corpor , he kidnap navill ( ian holm ) spoil daughter celin ( cameron diaz ) and hold her for ransom . the joke here is that celin is a will victim--h father threaten to cut her off financi , so she want revenge--and that she soon becom not onli an accomplic but the brain behind the scheme , teach the inept robert a thing or two about kidnap . . . and , ultim ( didn't we see this one come ? ) , love . so far , so mediocr . but mediocr is better than dread , which this film is , thank in no small part to the hodg contextu frame for the romanc . it turn out that god is displeas with the divorc and romant breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven polic , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatch two angel , o'reilli ( holli hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celin and robert--or lose their angel status . this conceit might have work if the angel dimens play an integr role in the entir pictur . but it could have easili been cut without ani clear loss to the film ; as it stand , it is simpli a wast of time that distract from the romanc at hand . not that there is much of a romanc to begin with . tri as diaz and mcgregor may , celin and robert are too one-not to becom veri endear charact . celin is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . as such , it is quit hard for the audienc to realli connect with these two--then again , they never seem to realli connect with each other . when celin and robert start to overt act on their " feel , " it come off more like someth script than anyth natur . but i am not exact sure if boyl and compani point was romanc ; honest , i am not exact sure what they were tri to accomplish . boyl juic up the visual with his characterist razzmatazz , but it remain just that--energi , not energi in servic of a stori or even act . the cast seem lost , especi hunter , whose perform is so adrift as to be baffl . and then there are the mani eccentr splatter onto the film : some violent confront involv the angel , who are not exact angelic--in fact , they end up stage their own ransom scheme ; some mystic hokum in the climax ; and a cutesi claymat epilogu . watch much of a life less ordinari is like be trap in indi hipster hell , stockpil quirk in the name of cool . instead , the film just give quirki a bad name . my best guess as to what the filmmak want to accomplish is an atmospher of warp womant ( yes , misspel intend ) whimsi , which come through in onli one scene : an extend music number where celin and robert sing " beyond the sea " at a karaok bar . after a vers or two , the coupl are magic doll up in snazzi outfit and hairdo , and engag in a spirit danc routin on the counter . the scene work not onli becaus of it relat simplic but also becaus it doe not tri too hard , just reli on the innat charm of the lead , allow them to build a romant rapport . ala , not near enough is built , for this moment come to an abrupt end . i applaud ani attempt to bring someth fresh and uniqu to movi hous , but sometim even clever can reach overkil . a life less ordinari certain deliv someth " differ , " but by the time the film was over , i was clamor for a life more ordinari . " i can accept failur . everyon fail at someth . but i can't accept not tri . it doesn't matter if you win as long as you give everyth in your heart . " --michael jordan
1 after sixteen year franci ford copolla has again return to his favorit project , make the third instal in the godfather-trilog . this new film has been underr for no reason . it is as intellectu and majest made as copolla pervious film . it is also more psycholog , pessimist and more tragic than the first two . the onli regret is the unconvinc perform by the newcom sofia copolla and some " unfinish " develop of some charact . the film eleg begin with nino rota recogniz music score , the beauti skyscrap of new york and michael voic as he is write a letter to his children : " the onli wealth in this world is children . more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasur " . the year is 1979 and michael corleon has use the time sinc the end of " part ii " to make his father dream come true - make the corleon famili legitim . michael sold all his casino and invest onli in gambl . constant haunt by the past , his onli reason to live is his children . the famili has amass unimagin wealth , and as the film open michael corleon ( al pacino ) is be invest with a great honor by the church . later that day , at a recept , his daughter announc a corleon famili gift to the church and the chariti of sicili , " a check in the amount of $100 million . " but the corleon are about to find , as other have throughout histori , that you cannot buy forgiv . sure , you can do busi with evil men insid the church , for all men are fallibl and capabl of sin . but god doe not take payoff . the plot of the movi , concoct by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspir by headlin , bring the corleon famili into the inner circl of corrupt in the vatican . there is a moment in " godfath iii " where michael say : " all my life i have been tri to go up in societi , where everyth was legal . but the higher i go , the crookier it becom . . " . visual this film is as spectacular as the first two . gordon willi rich cinematographi , carmin copolla beauti composit and alex tavoulari wonder art direct could not be better . but copolla first two godfather-film were more famous for their deep , intellectu plot , tree dimension charact and incred act , than for their visual perfect . the third instal has onli the plot and visual . some charact could be much more develop and the act , although good , never accomplish to reach the same height of the first two film . the biggest miscast is sofia copolla , who is so unconvinc and unemot that she manag to ruin sever scene throughout the movi , that could have been grander and more emot . the best perform come unsurpris from al pacino , who should have got a nomin for best actor at the oscar . andi garcia is power as sonni son , strong , focus and loyal . violenc is natur to him . he suffer no pang of conscienc when he take reveng on his famili behalf , and in this he is suppos to be strong in the uncompl way don vito corleon was . howev both kay ( dian keaton ) and conni ( talia shire ) are useless . and charact like vito corleon and tom hagen are realli miss . the good part is that michael is again reunit with old friend , that you rememb from the first and second film . in the third film michael has becom almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembl michael when he was much younger . this parallel could be more interest if vincenzo charact was more develop . mani have point out that make the third film , was unnecessari . i disagre . it is a beauti film of great import , complet the tragic saga of the corleon famili . the first film show some horribl result of corleon life . it show michael make a choic ; the second show a man damn himself for his choic and feel the impact of chang time . a man desper tri to keep his balanc , focus , famili and saniti , while everyth is crash all around him . the third film is a terrifi conclus - a result of michael life . the life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doom . there is no turn back . and no matter how hard you tri to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how power and wealthi you are , you are helpless - sink deeper and deeper till it swallow you complet . the beauti direct last sequenc is also the power climax of the film , when michael is sit alon in his chair , left by everyon , surround by empti and memori of his friend and famili member long dead . here he die - alon , miser and unforgiven
1 steve martin took an extend vacat from all facet of moviemak a few year back ; he spent this time write essay and short stori for " the new yorker , " sever of which wound up in his hilari hardback compil , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . much of the book spare tinseltown from mockeri , although he doe riff on the racist comment made by marlon brando dure a larri king interview , in a fine chapter call " in search of the wili filipino . " now , as writer and star of bowfing , he offer the mass plenti of good reason not to pursu a career in the cinema , perhap final vent the frustrat ( everyth be made now is crap ) that led to his brief retir from hollywood . martin star as bobbi bowfing , a roger corman-wannab on the cusp of fifti and desper for some success as a produc , qualiti of the project be damn . his account ( adam alexi-mall ) propos a movi call " chubbi rain , " about alien who travel to earth in raindrop slight fatter than regular raindrop . bowfing latch onto the idea immedi , and convinc his troup of actor friend to appear in the film , base on the lie that america top box offic draw , kit ramsey ( murphi ) , has agre to star . ramsey , of cours , want noth to do with such low-grad materi , so bowfing , on the think that action star need to run , not speak , decid to photograph the superstar surreptiti . he send his cast member ( who aren't in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hate the sight of camera and fratern with his co-star ) to ramsey tabl at restaur , ask them to follow him in park lot , etc . , spout script dialogu , all the while shoot the outcom from a great distanc . the paranoid ramsey flee the scene near everi time . ramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organ appar dedic to recruit celebr . ( as if that not familiar enough , mind head guru terri stricter ( terenc stamp ) has been dress and comb to resembl l . ron hubbard , founder of scientolog . ) when he goe to mind head with tale of caucasian stranger appear from nowher to babbl " white code " in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an import client and rush him off to a retreat , requir bowfing to find a stand-in . murphi will probabl win more fan as jiff , ramsey ador , ignoramus doubl , than as kit , but it is his portray of the latter that took courag . alway surround by an entourag , suffer from a racial inferior complex , murphi play right into the tabloid imag of himself . furthermor , consid the enemi he'll make of popular scientologist . pace stricter neutral-colour offic as if on an amphetamin bing and strip of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is ask to shout inan person affirm repeat . murphi scene with stamp are exact what i imagin of a john travolta " clear . " not that murphi is entir respons for this schtick ; bowfing is steve martin invent . his script is surpris clever as satir , given that the pseudo-religion is a sit duck , as is the entir los angel film industri . ( the griffin mill-typ take quit a beat , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerri renfro . ) martin decis to tell the stori from a bottom feeder point of view is what keep it fresh and innovative-nev have we seen on screen a group of peopl struggl this hard to complet a motion pictur . as expect , there are laugh onli to be had insid or buff , such as martin crew of mexican border-jump , who gain unexpect appreci for the classic from read " cahier du cinema , " or martin nonsens explan to dave , his loyal cinematograph ( jami kennedi ) , that everi movi , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollar ( ! ) . most of bowfing is univers funni , howev ; i defi ani viewer to keep a straight face when christin baranski , one of our brightest comedienn , is on screen . bowfing main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstanti aftermath . we'r also ask to believ that a few simpl close-up of kit ramsey would redeem " chubbi rain , " z-grade entertain that would make ed wood blush . ( this aspect of bowfing has much in common with the ludicr oscar sequenc in oz last directori effort , the poor conceiv in & out . ) these are signific enough weak that they distract from my enjoy of the piec . as i mention at the start of this review , bowfing offer solid reason not to do what heather graham charact daisi doe : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . that said , it offer one fantast reason to get on that bus : the sens of communiti between filmmak who gel is awesom . martin get sentiment by stori end as he did in l . a . stori , and how could he not ? for those who can hack it , the movi might be the greatest busi in the world .
0 iron , one of the theme of 200 cigarett is that you should tri to make the best of everi moment in life . unfortun i will no longer be abl to say that i live everi moment of my life to the fullest , becaus i spent 95 otherwis perfect good minut , watch this sad excus for a movi . actual smoke 200 cigarett in the same 95 minut couldn't be ani wors for you than it is to watch the movi . not onli is it a pathet bad film overal , but 200 cigarett actual has no redeem qualiti whatsoev . the plot is scatter , thin and predict ; the act is monument bad ; and the style of film make resembl a home video . it is decemb 31 , 1981 and the big parti is at monica ( martha plimpton ) hous . but no one has arriv yet . her 8 invit guest and sever peopl that they have pick throughout the even are wander the street of new york citi in various group . some of them know each other through their common bond of have slept with monica , and some are total stranger . but they all are to face their own person neuros befor night end . those who are invit are the one that have the issu . it is up to those who aren't to help them come to term . first there is eric ( brian mccardi ) who is a former boyfriend of monica and is just get over the heartbreak of their relationship termin prematur becaus of his sexual perform , or lack thereof . he is one of the most bland charact , in a film full of dull , becaus he is so utter predict and stereotyp , a common trait of this poor product . bridget ( nicol parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherston ) who are both extrem sensuous young women look for someon to handl their desir on new year eve and tag along to the parti with them . they stumbl across a nameless bartend ( ben affleck ) who is the one truli perfect charact in a film of imperfect . he is nether sexual depriv , nor uncertain about his futur , as he is in law school . his lack of flaw is both bore , unrealist and pain to watch . as bridget and caitlyn make pass at him you are neither entertain nor humor by the sub-standard comedi . move on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephi , ( gabbi hoffman ) 2 teenag girl with fake identif and veri differ thought . val is monica cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . on the other hand , stephi is convinc that she is vulner to crime when the two ventur out of their usual locat in search of the parti that they just can't find . paradox , it is 2 punk that they meet at a bar ( actual they attempt to flee from their presenc , but aren't success ) who guid them through their fear and forc a level of relax upon their warp mind . of all the insan dull and uninterest coupl , onli one approach a level of decenc in both act and plot . wise , the movi creator have put heavi emphasi on luci ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friend and share the common bond of be dateless . paul has just broken up with long time steadi elli ( janean garofalo ) and is start to come to term with his loss when luci inform him that elli had been sleep around dure their relationship . howev , the onli complex to these two charact is that they seem to want to be more than friend , and that is reiter when they attempt sexual intercours in a bathroom stall on more than one occas dure this strang even . final , there are the two worst perform and worst sub-plot of the film . jack ( jay mohr ) and cindi ( kate hudson ) have been go out for a short period of time and jack just learn that he took cindi virgin the night befor . while she attempt to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predict self loath male as he attempt to deal with a string of one night stand that includ the recent deflow cindi . veri often , when a film is as putrid as this product , there will at least be a decent qualiti of film make to reveal an occasion moment of glori . howev , this film has neither the qualiti of cinematographi nor the moment of glori to be highlight . instead , what you get is a collect of rough and inconsist cut , bad continu and inaccuraci . first , and most notic is that as the film goe from one subplot to anoth , there is no appar order that it follow , and it is also weeken by unnecessarili edgi edit from scene to scene and shot to shot . at other time , object seem to get up and move and hairstyl and costum chang from shot to shot . there are also at least 4 scene in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . not in a singl one of them doe anybodi pay the driver . and yet , no matter how miser this film may be , and no matter how poor the act is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these mani bad plot . perhap , if the maker had just decid to concentr on one or two or , perhap , even three , there might have been the time and opportun for some charact develop , or qualiti act , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . but it didn't happen that way . the cast of qualiti name actor was forc into role that not even one of them could convert into a mediocr perform , and everi stori line crash and burn quicker than it take for the ball to drop at midnight .

1 there are some work of art that are almost imposs to review , not becaus of their own complex , but becaus of their legendari status which prevent the review to say anyth origin . one of such masterpiec is casablanca , probabl not the best film in the histori of the seventh art , but definit the most popular one . it popular can be measur not in a multitud of more or less disguis remak that were made in more than half a centuri sinc it premier , but also in countless tribut and refer that movi maker use in their work to this day . casablanca is also a movi that has the veri rare virtu of both be prais by the critic and love by general audienc . one of the thing that make this film even more uniqu was the fact that it was doom to fail , at least judg by convent movie-mak wisdom of it time . it was base on a broadway play so mediocr that it hadn't been produc on stage ; screenplay by three writer - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was bee written as shoot went along ; the main actor were produc second choic , and , final , man behind camera , michael curtiz was consid to be capabl , but not great director . howev , the movi was commerci success and earn three " oscar " , includ the one for the best film . until this veri day , it is consid to be the best exampl of hollywood film- make in it own golden age . the plot of the movi was heavili influenc by the need of ww2 propaganda , yet it also use rather complic and now almost forgotten polit circumst of that global conflict in order to make intrigu stori . in decemb 1941 , casablanca , exot port on the atlant coast of north africa is control by offici neutral , yet nazi-collabor french vichi govern . thousand of refuge from war-torn europ are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safeti of america , and readi to pay ani price for precious exit visa . mani shadi charact thrive on their miseri , includ the corrupt polic chief , captain renault ( rain ) . his best friend is rick blain ( bogart ) , who use to be idealist anti-fascist , and now own popular night club in casablanca and live by his own cynic philosophi of " stick his neck for nobodi " . howev , everyth chang when he get in possess of two precious extra visa . this event coincid with the arriv of two new refuge to casablanca . one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resist leader who escap three time from nazi concentr camp and becam the legend of enslav europ . he is accompani by his beauti wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormi affair in the eve of nazi occup of pari . the coupl need visa , especi becaus of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) be on their trail . rick is now forc to choos between love , wound pride , self-preserv interest and his own hatr of fascism . the cast for this movi seem influenc by divin inspir - humphrey bogart , most legendari actor in the histori of cinema , is one of the rare charact actor who elev his persona to the star status . bogart portray of rick as complic man , torn between idealist past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forev be connect with that charact . anoth icon in his compani is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artist and visual prime . the cinemat coupl of bogart and bergman becam one of the main symbol of that era of filmmak - some happier time when the romanc on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporari work . for mani peopl , casablanca is probabl the best romant film ever made . but the reason for that isn't the romanc itself - it the realist stori of peopl forc to make tough , and often wrong choic in their life . the cast of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main lead . the support actor also did a marvel job . sidney longstreet and peter lorr were here main to give a mystic flavour spot in a previous bogart classic - john huston maltes falcon ; yet both of them manag to portray colour and origin charact . anoth shine exampl of good cast is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangl ; charact of victor laszlo has believ charisma and look like a somebodi who could inspir million of peopl to rise against nazi tiranni . unfortun , the charisma that burden laszlo , leav littl place for difficult choic , make his charact forev overshadow by rick/ilsa coupl . howev , rick and ilsa actual have a serious competiton for most memor charact in casablanca . captain renault , brilliant portray by claud rain in a role of a lifetim , was embodi of perfect , almost unmatch balanc between ethic corrupt and physic charm . despit be the undoubt villain in almost entir movi , rain manag to make renault sympathet charact , and his final convers to the side of good , symbol in not so subtl gestur at the end of movi look unnecessari . rain also gave anoth dimens to the movi , make it even more ambigu ; peopl who like to analys movi to death discov sign of homosexu in renault relationship toward rick , and rick final word leav room for even more outrag specul . togeth with well-drawn charact and excit stori , the movi was good in creat his own atmospher . profession nitpick would probabl have a field day in discov numer histor and geograph inaccuraci , but casablanca is still a shine exampl of hollywood ww2 movi that is beliav , if not realist . ani way , even if we don't see it as a histor document , casablanca is movi that can be sourc of entertain as well as infinit inspir .
1 when i was ask to see this movi with a friend , my initi reaction was ? not hugh grant ! ' i was perhap wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidi flirtat with a street hooker , i just could not pictur him in ani romant lead . what make this movi a wonder experi is not the fact it star hugh , but becaus it star julia and carri with it a brilliant written script . this writer richard curti , whose except first work ? four wed and funer show us that he is a master in the domain of the romant comedi , with splash of drama thrown in between . hugh and his hair , is almost ident to the charact that made him famous in ? four wed . he play an ordinari guy who is down and out on his luck . unfortun , he is type cast in this role , but fortun it work well for him in this movi . if onli he would dither a littl less . julia know this role well . the glamor movi star who is search for true love . there are moment in this movi , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneli . how sad it must be to be so wealthi and beauti , but to have no one to share it with . the writer deal with difficult issu of love and social class on various level . how differ in social stand can make it almost imposs for love to grow in such a harsh environ . how the media can be as cruel as it can be attent , and how fulfil in life and love can be found in forgiv and sacrific .

1 avail for rental - octob 12 , 1999 10 thing i hate about you is an updat of the classic play , the tame of the shrew . that said , drop ani pre-conceiv notion of what shakespear work is suppos to be like and welcom yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsess over the male peni ; a slight too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchel ) ; a new kid name cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model name joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey crush ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca sister - the shrew ( julia stile in a marvel perform ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short . with movi about high school similar to these run through projector like water down the nile , it would be quit easi to write off 10 thing i hate about you as just anoth doltish comedic-rom . yet , you must realiz that the stori is timeless , and a few hundr year later it is equal as witti and comic as when elizabeth gleefulli look on , groundl below and stuf brassier on stage . the first remind of the origin scribe can be found in katarina and bianca last name : stratford . their famili is run by walter stratford ( pretti woman larri miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenag pregnanc and guard his children accord . in what he think to be a moment of iron humor , the famili " no date " polici is amend to " bianca can date . . . when [katarina] doe . " with prom just ahead , bianca fate is grim ; unless , of cours , she can tame the shrew . don't think this mission to be a simpl one , as bianca kind point out , her sister " . . . is a particular hideous breed of loser .

" in this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca . cameron friend , a loser by teenag verdict , convinc joey to pay someon who has enough gut to take the shrew out . the solut lie no farther away than the second blatant remind of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . this verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previous laid his scene in prison . moreov , katarina open opin to the aforement english teacher that " hemingway was an alcohol who hung around picasso , hope to nail his leftov . " the law of high school cinema inexor turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet . provid a constant remind of the fact that this isn't exact what shakespear had in mind are the element obligatori to a high school comedi : a parti pollut with liquor , a best friend betray , and prom . it is the latter that has becom infam for close film like drive me crazi , american pie , never been kiss , carri , she all that , and can't hard wait . yet sure even these practic have root in shakespear ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a parti , and caesar learn about loyalti the hard way .
0 word i thought i'd never write : the sequel to urban legend lack the grace , wit , and power of the origin . put the gun to my head , pull the trigger , and put me out of my miseri . better yet , put the horror genr out of it miseri . when you'v finish watch urban legend : final cut , you'll share my same grim point of view thank to the horribl act , terribl script , and ridicul direct which has becom all too common today . urban legend : final cut is a smorgasbord of stolen movi idea ( main from the blair witch project and scream ) : fabul peopl with perfect teeth and skin , one creepi film school , and a dog eat a fresh remov kidney from one of the movi hapless victim . urban legend deliv a stori about a bunch of film student work on their thesi film to win the covet " hitchcock award " which guarante the winner a director deal in hollywood . one femal filmmak ( jennif morrison , the freaki dead girl from stir of echo ) write a fiction script base on a serial killer who kill his victim accord to " urban legend " tale . sudden , her entir crew start get bump off with urban-legendari homicid , but the bodi are alway miss and she is often the onli wit to the kill . the killer wear a fenc mask and a long black overcoat , look like a scorn olympian out to aveng his defeat in sydney . whi this is scari is never explain . of cours , the golden rule of sequel is that there must be least one recur charact for continu sake . urban legend has one minor , recur charact from the origin who we never care about anyway ( the secur guard , of all peopl ) . the other central problem is that this charact has alreadi seen the urban legend kill onc befor , but she utter clueless about what go on around her . call it suspens of disbelief . this film is also a prime exampl of how horror film are now complet dead in the water . the last decent horror film was the blair witch project , and that seem more like a snuff film than fiction . the stalk killer with crazi motiv has becom a tire clich ? , as everyon seem to have forgotten : real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown .
0 whenev u . s . govern start meddl into other countri affair , under the pretext of support human right or prevent polit , religi or ethnic persecut , the other side is readi to use mantra that say " look who talk ! what have you done to the indian ? " howev , even the american themselv are readi to use that dark chapter of their own nation histori when it suit their purpos . hollywood is just anoth exampl , with it revisionist western , made in earli 1990s . those movi tri to exploit the emerg wave of polit correct , coincid with the 500th anniversari of columbus discoveri of america . one of such exampl is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western direct by walter hill , film that deal with one of the last conflict between american nativ and white settler . the hero of the film is geronimo ( play by wes studi ) , leader of apach , fierc warrior tribe that use to give hard time to white settler dure the second half of 19th centuri . when the movi begin , in 1885 , geronimo and his apach made peac with u . s . govern and tri to live peac in arizona reserv . howev , broken promis , injustic and violenc against his peopl would make geronimo restless . with not more 30 or so of his follow , he escap reserv and begin guerrilla campaign . general crook ( gene hackman ) , command of u . s . armi forc , respect geronimo and know that even his 5 , 000 forc isn't enough to catch geronimo in the great space of the american southwest . instead , he turn to peopl who are more experienc with apach - lt . charl gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duval ) . togeth with young lt . britton davi ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aim at captur geronimo . geronimo : an american legend , like mani movi made under the shadow of polit correct , tri to tell the tale about oppress minor , but instead the real subject is the bad conscienc of the oppressor . so , the stori about geronimo is told from the perspect of his enemi . almost all of them happen to be his greatest admir and use everi opportun to express how sorri they feel for have to fight him and his peopl . although such element of john millius screenplay do inde have some basi in histori , they harm the stori of geronimo . to be honest , walter hill doe tri to make geronimo the real hero of the film , but the movi segment that deal with the plight of apach and the upris are given too littl time . instead , they turn out to be noth more than the back stori for rather uninterest adventur stori of gatewood and his band . to make even wors , hill has some real problem with pace and style , and in the end we have impress that we are watch two film bad edit into one - stori about geronimo and stori about his pursuer . the movi should have been better if it turn to geronimo life befor and after his last upris , in mani way more interest than the stori about gatewood . the differ between those segment could be observ through the differ qualiti of act . wes studi , cheroke actor who was so impress as magua in the last of the mohican , was perfect choic for geronimo , not onli becaus he resembl geronimo , but becaus he induc a lot of passion in his role . contrari to him , we have disinterest actor who sleepwalk through the role of his white enemi . while this could be expect from someon like jason patric , it is shame when we have veteran like gene hackman or robert duval . even hill direct is bellow expect - battl scene are too short and , like in mani of his late film , forc viewer to ask what had happen to the great action director of 1970s . even his old associ , music compos ry cooder , disappoint , with the score that shift between indian motiv and classic . on the other hand , photographi by lloyd ahern ii , with the use of red lens , give somewhat dreami atmospher , ideal for this movi that was suppos to be melanchol epic . all in all , compar with some of the hollywood exampl of polit correct , this film isn't so bad , but we are left with the unpleas impress that it could have been better .
1 let me open this one with a confess : i love cop movi . i ador them with such an unwav , near foolish passion that i was actual one of the first in line to see 1998 one tough cop star the smirkiest of the baldwin brother , steven . was it ani good ? well , just about as good as baldwin steven seagal impress ( for those i'v confus the answer is a resound no ! ) . now let me clarifi , i don't love just ani cop movi ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddi cop flick that were so in vogu in the 80 and now slowli ( gulp ) return thank to jacki chan and chris tucker . i'm partial to those gritti , earthi cop drama like serpico , donni brasco , and the french connect . problem is these film come along just about as often as georg w . bush make a cogent point so whenev a " true " cop movi doe hit multiplex , i come run toward it like an eager puppi ? ? ? and inevit i leav , head bow , trip over my squigg tail . so what is it about cop movi that transform me into a moron will to shell out $7 . 50 for a movi call one tough cop ( which actual sound a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? truth is i'm a sucker for those barren street , that gritti , graffiti strewn modernist jungl where danger crimin lurk and cop , like modern day knight , must shield us from their iniquit clutch . yes it all veri corni and aw boy clubish , which , i'm guess , is precis where these feel come from . as littl tot us boy are brought up to creat our own war with gi joe , enact cop and robber or cowboy and indian fantasi , etc . the best gritti cop film tap into those gleeful adolesc fantasi , and heighten them , turn it all into an existenti nightmar of thin moral line and psycholog chao . as an adult my tast haven't chang all that drastic ; sure i can get a cerebr high from the emot complex of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promis a " guy " film could potenti bring . now what if it the cop who'r the corrupt one ? ooh that one realli get me go , these protector use all that at their servic , take advantag of other for their own gain . throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) into the pot and you have the tremend absorb sidney lumet film princ of the citi . how absorb is princ of the citi , you ask ? so damn absorb that when the film shift from gritti undercov cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genr i loath the way kristi swanson must loath sarah michell gellar ) i remain complet and utter involv . the film star treat william , who give the kind of perform that should have skyrocket his career up to the level that brad pitt current resid at . sinc i was hatch a mere two year prior to the releas of princ of the citi , i cannot provid an answer as to whi it didn't . ( though judg from his recent role in tripe like deep rise and dead heat i would guess that it probabl has someth to do with quit a few bad career move ) . like mickey rourk and eric robert ( both of whom are current do time in direct to video purgatori ) william is a talent lead man who didn't make it to where he should have . ( if there was ani justic in this dog gone world keanu reev would be the one banish to direct to video hell ) . here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino in serpico ( also direct by lumet ) . william play danni ciello , a member of an elit squad of polic offic who take down drug dealer on the gritti pre-juliani street of new york . they work without uniform or hour much like paid vigilant . and that analog is more than apt see as how the bunch are kinda sorta forc into use corrupt mean to get the job done . the squad reli entir on inform ( low level junki ) to gain access to the big wig , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometim have to provid the junki with the junk of their choic . danni has done this , and though he a fair honor guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intent have gotten a bit skew along the way . he seek redempt and conclud that the best way to go about get it is by talk to intern affair who then convinc him to go undercov as a " doubl agent " . he doe so with one condit : he will not rat on his partner . right away we know that that is exact what he'll have to do . and watch the movi build to that is thrill in the way that ani great charact driven stori can be . undercov cop film are almost innat excit , even the kind that pull out all the clich ( like in too deep ) . how can one not be move by the issu of betray , ambigu , and the danger in put oneself in such a riski posit ? princ of the citi take all this and charg it with a percept , hard boil script and taut unintrus direct by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a hand of intens perform , most notabl by treat . lumet greatest contribut to the movi is how he lay back , and let the camera soak up the action . his scene transit rapid from one to the next build layer of tension , and he rare hold for reaction shot , instead he click away at precis the moment a charact stop yakk . lumet worst tendenc is one that mani film maker ( especi oliv stone ) tend to overus : he reli a littl too heavili on actor shout their line at each other presum in order to ratchet up the tension . this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night fall on manhattan , lumet most recent cop \ lawyer endeavor , a movi that near gave me an ulcer from just watch . though of late lumet has made sever realli aw career choic ( mayb he and treat should get togeth for a drink or someth ) , the most recent a complet unnecessari remak of gloria , here he was on , sustain tension in a film that run for 167 minut with not one dull spot . some of the formula pictur i like the best are the most simplist . hollywood often forget how easi it is to make these kind of pictur even toler . of cours cop movi aren't popular anymor ( yes buddi cop flick are popular but those are more like extend sitcom with gunfir amid the punch line ) , but just look at the averag hollywood action movi , flick so bloat and full of unnecessari fat like the bore love interest that serv no purpos other than to stall the action and demonstr that our hero isn't gay , the lame comic relief charact who never funni , and on and on . for all it moral ambigu princ of the citi is a back to the basic cop \ courtroom drama that leav out all the crap and realli thrill . it focus complet on it stori , and it charact all of whom are complet believ from the cop to the lawyer to the junki . there a great scene earli on where an irat william shout at an ia offic and look as if he about to go into one of those corni braveheart inspir speech , but instead he break down in front of the cop and begin sob . this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willi sacrific his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out becaus the director would say oh that make him too human , excus me , weak . in the veri next scene danni speak in a hush raspi , strain to get the word out . he lost his voic . doe that littl itti bitti detail matter ? mayb not to most , but it sure made my night . and in a sprawl epic of corrupt , greed , betray and violenc it nice to see that someon is pay attent to the littl thing .
1 director domin sena ( who made the high underr kalifornia ) and produc jerri bruckheim ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertain remak of the 1974 film of the same name that absolut no one has ever seen . nicola cage play memphi , a retir car thief who " pull back in " to the busi by an evil car thief overlord ( christoph eccleston ) determin to kill memphi kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) . memphi is order to steal 50 car in four day time or his brother will meet an unfortun demis , all while have to elud the detect hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feel the job should have been given to him and his gang . memphi set out to put his old crew back togeth , but discov that most of them have retir as well . gone in sixti second doe thing right from the open credit . in that sequenc , we get a rockin littl tune from mobi , along with some simpl back stori told onli with photograph and assort object . filmmak can sometim make or break a film just from it open titl sequenc , and this one easili get you in the mindset for an entertain ride . and what follow doesn't disappoint . . . cage turn in one of his good perform here ( he can easili go either way . . . good or bad . . . i don't know how he doe that ) , and his manner and dialogu deliveri carri the film along nice . of the support cast member , angelina joli as memphi former love is in the film just to provid eye candi ( she definit the hottest look greas monkey i'v ever seen ) and robert duval as memphi former mentor is just around to lend the film some class . also , i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday . none of these three perform are given much to do unfortun . some underr perform howev are given meati support role . delroy lindo ( get shorti ) shine as the exasper detect in pursuit of memphi , as doe timothi olyph ( go ) as lindo partner . i just wish some of the other charact could have been as import . the onli real gripe i have about the film though is it conclus . . . main becaus you know how it will end befor the open credit even roll . there no doubt in anyon mind that the 50 car will be success stolen , and the filmmak blew a perfect good opportun to add some suspens to the pictur by use the " rival car thief " plot line . as it stand , that stori line is wrap up about halfway through the film in a tidi littl packag . but if i was make this film , i'd have had the rival gang tri to get to the car befor memphi and his crew , therebi make memphi have to improvis . . . therebi ad some meat to the plot . the final is essenti just a big car chase , and there just aren't way to make car chase interest anymor . it all been done . the chase is also shot and edit in that " jerri bruckheim action sequenc " kind of way that leav the audienc wonder what specif is go on in the scene . sure it a car chase , but what exact are the particular of it ? it veri hard to tell . final , there a stunt dure this scene that come close to challeng the " bus jump the ramp " sequenc from speed in the " oh , i don't think so . . . " depart . despit those minor complaint , gone in sixti second is pure summer movi entertain . it not thought provok , but it shini , loud and fun . . . just what a summer flick should be . [pg-13]
0 godzilla is the ultim culmin of the " who care about plot " summer movi . a loos remak of the 1954 " classic " japanes monster movi , godzilla , king of the monster ( which is itself pretti thin in the stori depart ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disast flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . the script isn't just " dumb down , " it lobotom . godzilla live and die on special effect alon . presum , the primari target group for this film is teenag boy , the demograph most like to shell out $7 repeat to see the same imag of monster-instig carnag . that not to say that femal and other age group are immun to the special effect seduct ; they'r just not as readili suscept . this is the third straight movi in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstr that a masteri of computer-gener visual is far more import for make money than the abil to write and direct for actor . stargat was a financi success . independ day was a runaway hit . and , with godzilla alreadi drown in hype and merchandis tie-in befor it even open , it virtual guarante at least $100 million . nice number for a film that could have been pen by a not-too-precoci grade school kid . godzilla isn't complet without merit , although it is close . there a certain viscer thrill inher in watch the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wear off quick . frank , while the special effect are compet , they'r not all that stun . there noth new here ; it jurass park meet alien , with a littl independ day thrown in for bad measur . mayb it will requir georg luca and his new star war movi to take computer-gener visual to the next level . godzilla never realli push the envelop , prefer to remain within a comfort zone . the imagin of monster movi like king kong has been replac by a crass , formula approach which disallow creativ . ( how disturb is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cann film festiv ? ) worst of all , godzilla isn't even excit . with the possibl except of a mild enjoy car chase near the end , there isn't a sequenc in this film that rais the puls . even the scene with dozen of aircraft attack the monster are so devoid of tension and suspens that they are yawn-provok . independ day may have been dumb , but it was full of " adrenalin moment " capabl of get the audienc involv in the action . in this aspect of it product , as in so mani other , godzilla is lack . actual , part of the problem is that we'r never sure who we'r suppos to be root for : the green monster with an attitud or the paper-thin human tri to stop him . the plot , such as it is , can be sum up rather simpli . after sink a few ship and leav some footprint on tropic island , godzilla show up in the big appl . he doe some of the usual tourist thing : stop by madison squar garden , visit the chrysler build , goe on a walk through central park , and take the subway . in the process , he knock over a few build and step on countless cab , but he never has troubl with traffic jam . on hand to stop him is an elit u . s . armi unit , led by a slight less-arrogant-than-usu militari man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist name nick tatopoulo , who has a theori about godzilla . in his opinion , the big guy is actual a lizard grown to enorm proport as a result of the radiat given off by french atom bomb test in the south pacif . in nick word , godzilla is " a mutat aberr ? an incipi creatur ? the first of it kind . " as luck would have it , nick old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a report base at a new york tv station . along with her cameraman friend , anim ( hank azaria ) , she decid to follow nick around as he trail godzilla . then , just when the militari has reject nick theori about whi godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret servic ( jean reno ) recruit him for a special assign . instead of stomp around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york citi . unfortun , manhattan has been destroy so mani time in recent disast movi ( independ day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it becom bore . the whole tradit of monster roam around the citi start with king kong , but the big ape was onli about 30 feet tall . he could climb the empir state build . at ten time that height , godzilla would be more like to knock it over . godzilla contain a few lame attempt at humor . there an ongo feud between anim and his wife that play like sit-com materi , an unfunni and repetit gag about how no one can pronounc nick last name proper , and a rather tame attack on film critic roger ebert and gene siskel . both of the popular person have alter ego in the film : " ebert , " the mayor of new york , is play by michael lerner , and " gene " ( lorri goldman ) is his campaign manag . ebert re-elect slogan is , not surpris , " thumb up for new york . " the siskel/ebert stuff is amus the first time it use , but , after a while , it grow tiresom . and , although the " charact " don't serv ani real purpos , they keep pop up . godzilla is saddl with an unimpress cast . this is larg becaus emmerich doesn't want to risk a human perform upstag his lizard . that not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren't capabl of good perform ( both have done their share of solid act in the past ) , but they aren't a-list name . then again , consid the qualiti of the write , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- press to shine . maria pitillo ( dear god ) play the love interest and hank azaria ( great expect ) is on hand to present what is suppos to be comic relief . ultim , it doesn't realli matter what i ( or ani other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movi . tristar has assum that godzilla , like all self-proclaim summer event motion pictur , is pretti much critic-proof . it may also be word-of-mouth-proof . those who want to see the movi will see it no matter what i write or their friend say . so , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiot blockbust movi of all time , it like spit into the wind . emmerich and devlin are master illusionist , wave their wand and mesmer audienc with their smoke and mirror . it probabl too much to hope that some day , movie-go will wake up and realiz that they'v been had .
1 cinemat speak , gordon park origin 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . a bit slow at time and more than a littl rough around the edg as it build to it climact explos of violent action , this spirit but formula yarn that initi brought ernest tidyman " black privat dick that a sex machin to all the chick " to the big screen hard qualifi as groundbreak filmmak . yet near 30 year after it origin release--and long after the genr it spawn , " blaxploit , " die with that decade--th 1971 _shaft_ remain an extrem entertain watch , never have complet escap pop cultur conscious . the reason for this is the same one that explain the film connect with moviego far beyond the target african-american audienc : the titl charact of john shaft . while the fact that the strong , smart , viril , and superbl suav shaft is black is the primari factor for his histor and cultur signific , his broad-bas appeal stem from an idea that transcend race : he is comfort , confid , and proud about who he is , and anyon who had a problem with that could simpli kiss his ass . this fact also explain whi john singleton y2g reviv of john shaft is as enjoy as it is . much like the film that start the franchis , this _shaft_ plot doesn't score point in the origin depart , but the energi level and smooth attitud distinguish it from standard crime thriller . contrari to what has been report over the past few month , this _shaft_ is not a remak of the origin film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . the star audienc know and love from the origin film and it first two sequel ( 1972 _shaft's_big_scor ! _ and 1973 _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtre , onc again play john shaft , who still run a privat investig firm in new york citi . howev , the focus of the film lie on his same-nam nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begin , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constant leav him at odd with his superior . when a privileg young man name walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accus of a brutal , racially-motiv murder is allow to be releas on bail , a disgust shaft leav the forc and decid to take matter into his own hand as a p . i . but that easier said than done , for also stand in the way of shaft and his way of justic is peopl hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hire by walter to rub out waitress dian palmieri ( toni collett ) , the onli eyewit to his crime . peoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacl in jackson way toward command this film . peopl is more of an outrag comic charact for most of the run time , and wright is insan funni dure these stage . howev , he isn't so funni as to make the charact come off as goofi and buffoonish , and peopl eventu turn to more serious villaini is seamless and believ ( which probabl would not have been the case had he been play by origin cast choic john leguizamo , who bow out befor film ) . it no easi task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captiv , charismat self here ) , but that exact what wright does--and make it seem effortless . then again , with such a talent ensembl surround him , it is not too surpris that jackson impress star turn doesn't quit tower over the rest ; he is strong complement not onli by wright but all his other co-star . bale has alreadi proven his abil to play an uppiti killer in _american_psycho_ , so it onli follow that his perform as a similar , less exagger charact would be spot-on . collett lend the film some convinc and welcom dramat weight as the frighten , conflict dian . busta rhyme bring some good laugh as shaft sidekick rasaan . regist not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--ar vanessa william ( as tough narcot cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismay underus roundtre ; they simpli are given littl to do in the script credit to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . ( jackson also has littl to " do " in a sens ; some throwaway footag dure the open credit asid , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene . ) that singleton onc again prove his abil with actor is an especi good thing sinc he not realli an action director . this is not to say that he doe a bad job with the numer gunfight and the requisit foot and car chase . they move well ( as doe the film as a whole ) and are reason excit ; it just that there noth terribl invent about them . these set piec are function in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they'r unsurpris and convent . but if there anyth that a _shaft_ movi doe well , it make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keep that tradit aliv . from the slick titl sequence--scor , of cours , to isaac hay ever-infecti oscar-win theme song , which singleton wise sprinkl throughout the film--on , the film look great and easili sweep the viewer into it world with it energet bravado . even a common visual trick such as employ fanci wipe for scene transit not onli feel unforc , it feel necessari . style doesn't exact make for a great film , but when it come to _shaft_ , that of littl consequ . what matter abov all els is have a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of mani fun ride to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth .
0 you know someth , christma is not about present . it about over-hyp holiday film with lot of merchandis and product tie-in . at least that would seem to be the messag of " the grinch , " which has been advertis sinc last christma and whose logo is current plaster all over store . hollywood expect us to ignor this cynic greed as the movi scold us about lose the true spirit of the season . you know the plot : there this evil furri green guy call the grinch ( jim carrey ) who live on a mountain overlook whovill . down below all the whos are prepar for their whobil , but the grinch is determin to steal their christma . the movi is , of cours , a live-act version of the belov children book , which was previous adapt into a 1966 tv special by looney tune anim chuck jone . it rare that a big budget hollywood releas is shame by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon , but that the case when jone version is compar to ron howard . the tv grinch hit all the right note : bori karloff soft , deep narrat ; thurl ravenscroft sing " mr . grinch " ; max the dog weigh down by the gigant antler tie to his head ; and the grinch wide , toothless grin . by contrast , the movi hit one sour note after anoth . first , there are the numer bad choic that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in pad out the short book into a 105-minut movi . young wide-ey cindi lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depress about the misplac prioriti of her parent ( bill irwin and molli shannon ) dure the holiday season . she begin to sympath with the grinch , who turn out to be surpris sympathet . cindi lou discov that the grinch turn tear away from whovill in grammar school when he was public humili while express his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( play as an adult by christin baranski ) . are we expect to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christma ? the grinch isn't even the villain here ; that role is fill by the corrupt mayor of whovill ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch rival for martha affect . not onli are the charact needless complex , but the once-simpl plot becom so convolut that the actual theft of christma seem like an afterthought . the cast choic aren't ani better than the screenwrit decis . jim carrey seem woefulli miscast . while his face is so suppl that the rubber make-up seem superflu , carrey bring noth els to the role . his accent keep chang ; i assum he was shoot for karloff , but he end up sound like a weird slurri of richard nixon , sean conneri , and cartman from " south park . " not know what els to do dure his mani scene alon in the grinch home , carrey fall back on his stand-up comedi and clown around ace ventura-styl . needless to say , his wise-crack antic don't quit fit the charact of the grinch , who is an embitt loner fill with hate . littl taylor momsen bring littl to role of cindi lou except big eye and a cute smile . she would have been fine if cindi lou was limit to her origin purpos in the seuss stori ( find " santa " in her live room steal the tree ) . howev , the expand script make cindi as import as the grinch , and momsen is not up to the challeng . bottom line : when you'r steal christma ( movi ) , leav this one behind .
0 " alcohol and drug = bad . not alcohol and drug = good . got it ? " just when you though you'v seen enough of brave young women deal with their person problem on screen , be that insan or alcohol , hollywood releas yet anoth one of those deep , emot stori about find yourself . . 28 day is practic a visual of the usual meaning true stori that peopl are so proud retel at aa-meet . gwenni ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drown her problem in alcohol . for her life was a big parti , with no begin and no end . this behavior has of cours estrang her from her onli sister and from life itself . her exist is fill with endless parti and comic episod . such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( domin west ) , borrow her sister ( elizabeth perkin ) wed limo and crash it into someon hous . this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ord rehab . here she must realiz that the onli thing that can save her is her is redempt , willpow and commit . most import she must realiz her place and direct in life and understand that her life is not just a big parti . the film itself feel like a rehab program , whine and moan about thing that have been said and written a million time . it is a classic cautionari tale . an echo . a big , fat and expens clich ? . a shadow of last year girl , interrupt , which likewis follow in the footstep of great masterpiec like the cuckoo nest and trainspot . director betti thoma has stuf her film with so mani failur and error , that it is imposs to sum them all up in one review . for some paranoid reason she decid to make her film a drama/comedi . joke and funni charact almost deliber delud you from the realli import and complex issu : alien , despair , terror , confus , loneli . and what awesom power and strength of charact it actual take to overcom all that and becom clean . isn't that what the filmmak want to show in the first place ? even the transit process itself seem like a walk in the park . betti thoma idea of hell is a cozi , homey place where happi alcohol and cheer drug addict are not allow to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 . it is simpli too light , simplifi and unnecessari sweet to be taken serious . but the worst thing about it is that it actual think that it is say someth of signific . that it actual tri to educ the audienc with it extrem predict and primit stori . " all you need to do is just say no " , say dr . cornel ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revel of the centuri . and that how simpl it is ! in fact i would rather watch lost in space onc again , than return to 28 day . as for act , it accept , but hard anyth els . for sandra bullock it an opportun to demonstr that she is capabl of more than speed . she handl her part with a surpris profession and eas that certain save the film from be a complet flop . domin west shine as the sourc of gweni devilish temptat , but elizabeth perkin and steve buscemi great talent are wast on unnotic and shallow charact . although intellectu girl , interrupt was a greater achiev , 28 day is superior in it visual aspect . there are some nice flash back sequenc and occasion impress pace , but the overal technic aspect of this film is on the ground floor . the most import thing is that we'v seen it befor and it was a lot better . clean and sober , onli when i laugh , when a man love a woman , leav las vega and mani other stronger film were made about the same issu . so what the point ? in other word 28 day doesn't contribut to the moviemak busi on ani level . if you'r caught in a snowstorm or bolt of lightn fall from the sky and you'r stand in front of the movi theatr , you might as well go in and watch 28 day . under all other circumst stay away , becaus this film equal $8 and 103 minut lost .
0 the corruptor is a big silli mess of an action movi , complet with pointless plot turn and gratuit violenc . it not abhorr , or even blatant unlik , but it doesn't make a shred of sens . and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarri glen ross direct an action film ? jame foley know a lot about charact and act , and those are the strength of the corruptor . but the quiet scene clash with the ludicr action nonsens , and the result is less like a movi and more like a derail train . at least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role . chow play nick chen , a chinatown cop . he a good cop , as the first few scene establish , and he veri familiar with chinatown . that probabl whi the powers-that-b decid to team him up with a rooki name danni wallac ( mark wahlberg ) . nick and danni begin by step on each other toe , but final end up like each other onc they both get a chanc to save the other one life . what happen after that is kind of a mysteri to me . i'm fair certain that the villain are all part of the fukienes dragon , led by a young chines psycho name bobbi vu ( byron mann ) . i'm also pretti sure that nick is on the payrol of henri lee ( ric young ) , a gangster deal in prostitut and other neat stuff . i'm not quit sure whi henri lee decid to employ danni , although this make for some ridicul ( albeit unpredict ) plot twist along the way . there also an interest subplot revolv around danni father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn't have much to do with the main stori . one of the problem , as i said , is that the movi doesn't make ani sens . i don't blame this entir on foley , becaus he obvious a good director . i'm more inclin to point my finger at robert pucci script , which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal peopl act . one scene earli on had me particular annoy : nick confront his boss becaus he angri about his new white partner . he shout and point his finger and step on the furnitur , and i was think that i would have fire him if he had done that to me . ( in addit , the film take a bite into race-rel issu , and never develop them at all . ) there are a lot of scene like this one , and none of them are veri coher . there also a consider languag barrier , given that chow and some of the other actor have thick chines accent . the plot itself never straighten out . i'm not sure who or what the fukienes dragon are , or whi henri lee is associ with them , or what they do as a group . the corruptor is an action movi , and so all these weird plot develop are decor with loud and violent action sequenc . the sequenc aren't bad , but they'r not new ; how mani car chase through chinatown have you seen ? on that note , how mani chinatown cop movi have you seen ? one too mani , i'd imagin . foley strength is clear in character , and he doe a pretti good job here . the scene between nick and danni are veri good , and i actual got a feel for their charact ; a bond form between them that hold part of the film togeth . chow and wahlberg are both good actor ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . wahlberg seem less at home in this atmospher , but he still fun to watch . i also like the subplot involv danni father ; brian cox perform is power , and his charact make a compel moral compass for danni . but the film ultim fail , most at the hand of insan incoher and overly-familiar action scene . a complic plot can be success , but the stori need to make sens when it over . the corruptor never manag to make ani sens -- it just keep spin out of control until , final , there noth left to hold on to .
1 bob the happi bastard quicki review : the mummi brendan fraser stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has someth better to do than to quot sitcom line and tri to woo alicia silverston . . . fraser is the lead star of the mummi , the second directori effort from action director stephen sommer ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rise ) . it a rough adapt of the 1932 film , and i say rough becaus it focus more on special effect than on some guy in bandag , like bori karloff was engulf in . but who care , the movi has a sort of swashbuckl qualiti to it you can't get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon . fraser play a soldier who get a premonit dure a battl with soldier in an egyptian ground . basic , it a littl sign from the mummi buri underneath- a priest name ihmoetep who was buri aliv for take part of murder the king and make out with his mistress . his plan- wake back up and wake her up also , make him invinc . of cours , fraser return to the site year later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddi of his ( deep rise kevin j . o'connor ) and some " american " . . . and guess what ? yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awaken and wreak havoc . fire fli from the sky , flesh-eat beetl crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep plan begin to unfold . ok , so it not realli all that new a stori , but the way sommer tell it is entertain enough . the special effect from industri light and magic are top notch , and the act from fraser and weisz isn't half bad either . the action is pretti intens ( favorit scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shock scene just to jolt you horror-lov folk as well . no , it no phantom menac beater , but if you'r look for a solid warm-up to the summer movi season , you won't find a better film under wrap than the mummi . if this doesn't give fraser forgiv from blast from the past and encino man , then noth will .
1 the premis is simpl , if not bizarr . a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrest ) launch an average-jo ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forc his subject to watch the most horrend movi ever made . whi ? it tortur , it maniac , and it just plain fun . base on the cult-favorit cabl televis seri , mysteri scienc theater 3000 : the movi isn't tortur , but as for be maniac and just plain fun , it foot the bill quit nice . mike nelson , on a dog-bon shape spacecraft , spend his day as ani young man would dream - indulg in sarcasm and horseplay , and see quit a few movi . the catch is , these movi aren't the movi he choos , but retch exampl of film-mak chosen specif by dr . forrest in an attempt to break mike will to live . dr . forrest is convinc that one too mani b- movi is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a coupl of wise-crack puppet buddi ( tom servo , voic by kevin murphi , and crow t . robot , voic by beaulieu ) , the tortur becom somewhat of a honorari parti for all that is wrong in the world of cheezi cinema . the purpos behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst film known ( even if by veri few of us ) to man . we watch as the silhouett of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darken theater poke fun at the movi go on befor them . in this case , it the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth . we basic watch as our three lead watch , onli we get the pleasur of eavesdrop on their hilari commentari . the plot behind the movi rip apart are realli quit irrelev , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one . this island earth is the tale of two scientist , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intend to destroy the earth . togeth the two fight to surviv as well as save their home planet . to make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film natur has to be as horribl as possibl , and although the tv-seri introduc us to sever wors film than this island earth , it a bad enough flick to bring about some hyster cruelti . mst3k , which doesn't actual contain the complet this island earth , is a short 73 minut , but this is a step veri wise taken . as funni as some of their observ are , it can onli go so long . occasion break from this island earth also help the film tremend . although it take a second to get back into the right mode after this premis has been left for a moment , it better than overkil the whole concept post hast . mst3k lover will like hail the film great , but if you don't know what you'r in for , it could be a jar disappoint . although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three star , it is a movi to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not function to full capac anyway , and with a larg , saracast crowd - new year at midnight for exampl , which is when i saw it . warn : although mst3k has more to it end credit than most ( the three lead use the credit to poke some more fun ) , they are actual more annoy than most . the name slander and asinin one-lin were extrem unfunni , and after laugh for about 70 minut straight , it put a heavi damper on the overal experi . most peopl will like stay to see what the smart-alec have to say , but for me , it almost ruin an otherwis good film .
0 accord to the public materi , with this movi the director " hope to restor good old-fashion bowl to it right place in the mainstream of american conscious .

" . well , no , actual . the actor don't do the movi much favour either . woodi harrelson come off okay , plausibl act dumb , smart , cynic or innoc when the implaus script call for it , but randi quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegg , she seem more convinc play a computer-cr than a human -- take the tv seri weird scienc . . . pleas ) . even murray ham it up when he reappear in the movi climax . all in all , a fair useless attempt at comedi , and a certifi no-hop at kickstart the bowl renaiss . we'll have to look to a reinspir john water , or perhap somebodi from down under ( " strict bowl " , anyon ? ) for the definit bowl comedi . the fli inkpot rate system : * wait for the video . * * a littl creaki , but still better than stay at home with gotcha ! * * * pretti good , bring a friend . * * * * amaz , potent stuff . * * * * * perfect . see it twice .

0 capsul : the run gag pair of charact from all of kevin smith film get their own movi . the gag are sporad funni . it is more than occasion funni for teen who are fond of scatolog humor and anti-gay joke . the plot is weak and the lead are not a particular funni comic team . the littl insid joke and dig at other entertain and particular at kevin smith film are the best featur of the film . sad for me they were just not funni enough to make the film worth watch . this feel like the high school skit that that the princip would not let the kid do on talent night . ( and it turn out he had veri good reason . ) , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) a film need a plot . it need charact for empathi valu . it need a stori and an emot center . if a film is just a chain of joke it can onli be so good and ani entertain valu will succeed or fail base on how funni the joke are . kevin smith has now made two satisfi film , clerk and chase ami . with dogma he tri to make a philosoph religi comedi and mix with a madcap romp . peter cook and dudley moor did that veri success with their bedazzl . but get the combin to work is veri hard to do right and kevin smith fecal monster in dogma were not the way to do it . his remain two film , mallrat and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aim squar at a teenag audienc . jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay joke , peni joke , flatul joke , film pastich , and in-jok . how funni the joke are will be a subject call . for me , the vast major of the joke were just not veri funni . there was not enough clever or varieti . it is funni at most onc or twice to accus someon of be gay . peni joke work onli so mani time . show up as minor charact in everi kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human run gag . they were sort of the modern equival of naunton wayn and basil radford , the comic duo who show up satir the english middl class in sever good british post-war film includ dead of night , the ladi vanish , and passport to pimlico . jay and silent bob were origin suppos typic generat x stoner . as the seri wore on they had larger and larger part . in jay and silent bob strike back they are the lead . jay and silent bob ( play by jason mew and kevin smith ) are chase away from the front of the conveni store where they were deal drug in clerk . this leav them at loos end . they are not sure what would be worthwhil to do with their live when they hear that a comic book with charact visual model on them will be adapt into a movi . they decid to devot their live to wreck the movi or get some of that big movi industri cash . so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movi compani and have adventur along the way . the film is most about their adventur on the road and when they get to hollywood the problem with this comedi team is that neither realli pull his weight to make the film funni . silent bob , be silent , can onli contribut to the comedi by react with that veri express face of his . this make his piec of the comedi even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have . jay has to be the comic . he could carri the load for both if he were extrem invent . the problem is that he is not suffici funni . he is too bland to be the comic half and his line just do not show ani comic flair . so jay and silent bob are a long way from be a success comic team . their star role and the low humor make this a comedi for those young at mind and for peopl who can laugh at gag they have seen before--sometim just minut befor . like dogma befor it , but definit not like chase ami , this film feel more like an amateurish skit than a real movi . certain neither the plot nor the charact are at all involv . they are excus for gag , mani of which still fall flat . it is dogma without ani of the humor theolog content . the film doe not offer much to an adult audienc . i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
0 i am continu amaz at movi like this . that some produc would wast an abund of talent and money on a script as abysm as this one is mind-boggel , but it seem to happen a lot nowaday . " wild wild west " is a beauti film , well act , and well direct piec of garbag ; and it insipid screenplay is complet at fault . in short , this movi is a comedi without laugh . so mani joke fall flat that it borderlin surreal . the high product valu keep it from be a total fiasco , but it still pretti bore . will smith star as jim west , an old western , r&b variat of the jame bond charact . west is team up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they'r pretti much polar oppisit : west prefer to solv his problem with an array of bullet , gordon tradit favor a more pacifist approach . talk about deepli develop charact . at ani rate , this lead to the inevit conflict between methodolog , none of which are funni . the year is 1869 . sever top scientist have been abduct , and the suspect culprit is a disgruntl former confeder general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levin ) . presid grant send west and gordon to investig . there evid that mcgrath is attend some sort of confeder reunion in louisiana . west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actual work for dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , anoth disgruntl former confeder . as it turn out , loveless plan to use the combin knowledg of the scientest to creat the ultim super weapon , which he will use to conquer the unit state . i'd go further with the plot , but there isn't ani point . this film narrat is littl more than a jumbl , unfunni mess . i onli laugh at a coupl of joke , and then onli light . there isn't one truli upror funni moment in this film , and that pretti disaster when you consid that it primarili a comedi . as i said , the fault is total that of the script . when you consid their respect role , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibl done . the lead could'v been play samuel l . jackson and robert de niro and the film still would'v been aw . no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like " bye bye , mr . knife guy ! " sound good . still , this film has a lot go for it visual . the set design is fantast , mayb even oscar worthi . the cinematogrophi by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorses brilliant " goodfella " ) , is absolut stun . he lend the film a much need excit , comic bookish look . i won't fault barri sonnenfeld either . he doe a fine job of direct the proceed , but , like the rest of the peopl involv with the film , there realli isn't anyth that he can do to correct it one major flaw . despit be beauti made , " wild wild west " becom quit bore after the half-way point . the appeal of the visual end long befor the film doe . if " wild wild west " didn't look so good , it would be almost insuffer . as it is , it somewhat toler , but not veri entertain . it hurt to give such a well made movi a score this low , but there isn't anyth much wors than an unfunni comedi .
1 at one point dure brian de palma crime epic scarfac , the radiant michell pfeiffer turn to a rant al pacino and pop a question that the audienc has no doubt been want to ask for themselv : " can't you stop say fuck all the time ? " fuck good question , that . it may not be an honour that instil the filmmak with pride , but as far as i can tell oliv stone script contain the said expletit more time than ani other film in cinema histori . yet it would be a shame if bad languag is all de palma scarfac is rememb for , becaus this is a damn fine gangstar flick . the overal structur is similar to howard hawk 1932 origin , but this time the scene has switch to miami , florida and our anti-hero chosen vice is cocain traffik . pacino , sport a thick cuban accent , give one the best perform of his career ( golden globe nomin ) as toni montana , a cuban refuge with a crimin past who flee castro and come to america to live the american dream . and live it out he doe , with lash of violenc , abus , murder and the funni white powder . from his earliest job as a drug runner for various middlemen , toni montana make it clear to everyon he meet that he not a man to be fuck ( sorri ) . soon he the king of the cocain heap , but his hot head and an increas out of control drug addict prove his undo . " never do your own stash " , warn one charact earli in the film . as sure as night follow day , the emperor of miami eventu fall . writer oliv stone and director brian de palma make an explos combin here . stone script offer solid storytel and some fine charact develop . montana is fascin ; uneduc but calcul , a straight shooter who speak from the heart ; an ambiti , violent man yet one with a conscienc . a man fierc protect of his beauti 20 year old sister , not want her to be suck into the glitzi , danger world which he inhabit . pacino is dynamit , take to the role with a brood , bristl energi which in his more recent film has often degener into just simpl overract . pfeiffer also regist strong as the gangstar mole with no inner life . onli onc doe toni express real affect for her and his desir to have children , and even then you sens all he realli want is a regular screw and a beauti object to show off to his friend , and she happi to oblig . this isn't as meati a role for pfieffer as sharon stone was in casino , but it an effect one nonetheless and she aquit herself well . as director , de palma set up a number of dramat scene with his typic stylist brauva . the escal tension he creat in various mob situat - a drug deal gone wrong , an assin attempt - is often thrill , and in this respect he is everi bit the equal of scores and coppola . where he differ from , say , coppola godfath trilog is in his overal treatment . coppola give his crime saga an operat sweep , wherea in scarfac de palma opt for a grittier feel . and it perfect suit the materi . the onli major botch is giorgio morod most crap synthesi score . it just not right , and unfortun compromis the impact of some otherwis good scene . as expect , scarfac is veri violent at time , but you shouldn't be watch gangster movi if that upset you . at over two and a half hour in length it a true epic , and if you'r a fan of the genr you'll love f * * k-fill minut of it .
1 the latest epo from lar is a blast , although a rather moodi one . this lovestori is situat in a small town in the rough dreari cliff in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 someth . the church ( calvinist ) is so strict that the church bell has been remov from the clocktow , they are consid be too unrestrain . in these surround we find the to-be-w jan and bess , play by stellan skarsgaard and the remark new movi actress emili watson . jan is on leav from the oilrig and bess . . is just bess , a bit naiv and innoc ( in everi aspect of the word ) , at first . at the wed parti we are told an anecdot , illustr her infinit kind , she onc lend a bike to an stranger , her best friend bike howev . but bess is suffer in this scari religi societi . we soon take part in a funer where a man , fallen off the orthodox path , is laid to rest while doom to hell . women are not allow to attend funer or speak up in the church . when the end of the honeymoon approach we see bess idol jan in such an intend , almost manic , that her friend tri to calm her down a bit . the time has come when jan is to return to the rig , bess is fall into the dark of depress , her yell of grief and sorrow are heard abov the break of the wave . she can't stand the thought of life without her husband . we wit her dialogu with god ( she speak both part , paranoia ? ) convinc god to return jan from the oilrig , and her prayer are heard . an accid on the rig bring him back , paralys from the neck and down . now he can't satisfi her need for physic love , he tri to persuad her into find a lover , with the ulterior motiv to make her describ these affair to him in everi detail . at first she resist , but her love for jan and his assur that this will make him recov more rapid make her compli . imagin what this is do to the poor girl ? the stori is clever divid into eight chapter part by beauti pictur made by danish artist per kirkebi , accompani by music from the era ; procol harum , deep purpl , t-rex and other . the use of hand-held camera and lack of ani make-up make the charact solid and help to separ this movi from other in the sentiment genr . the incred perform from the actor make the movi brilliant , though a bit too gloomi for my tast . i would say that it is in the genr of betti blue ( 37 . 2 le matin ) and bitter moon ( lune de fiel ) . emili watson as bess and katrin cartlidg as her best friend dodo deliv outstand perform , this must be the reason for give it the " grand prix du juri " in cann this year ( although we had hope for the " palm d'or " ) . the screenplay is now avail in print , the transform be made in the period from ultimo may to juli , just in time for the danish premier .

" much to the horror of everyon stand within earshot . sever other variat on this wordplay surfac all throughout the film . if this movi had been smarter i would have been less like to fault it juvenil bathroom humor , but it not . the film was appar made for relat younger peopl becaus everi major player in the waterg scandal is introduc and shove down the audienc throat in the least subtl way possibl . i don't recal oliv stone nixon have to pander to it audienc , but of cours that film wasn't a comedi aim squar at a 13-20 year-old film go audienc . the onli redeem thing about this movi is it remark support cast . i want to see more of ferrel and mcculloch woodward and bernstein . those two charact are the sole basi for my rate . i wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortun , they are onli releg to the final half-hour . their constant bicker and fight over tri to get the stori are a major highlight , especi mcculloch constant thwart of ferrel attempt to gather inform from the girl ( who , in the cours of the narrat are reveal as deep throat , so name thank to an ill plan trip to a porno theater by betsi brother ) . the other member of the cast are excel in their portray of their particular charact , but are given noth to work with . i'd like to see the same cast portray these charact in a script more suit toward their comed abil . as for the two lead , dunst and william can definit do better . they come off as what could best be describ as romi and michel : the earli year in this particular film , a high dubious distinct at best . stay through the first half of the end credit though , to see an interest scene involv dunst and william suggest suck on lollipop emblazon with the titl of the movi . an excel idea mar by poor execut , dick could have been a great movi . less of the juvenil humor and more of the smarter comedi display by the woodward and bernstein scene , could have made this film a wonder satir of the nixon presid as seen through the eye of two naiv fifteen year old . as it stand though , dick offer noth but what filmmak kevin smith so accur defin as " dick and poopi " joke . and that , to me , doe not make a funni movi .

0 to put it blunt , ed wood would have been proud of this . a total ridicul plot is encompass with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay . also , a beauti anti-climact end . not to say it didn't look intrigu when i saw the preview . so much for truth in advertis . roland emmerich , who later " independ day " would look like " the 400 blow " compar to this , co-writ and direct this inan sci-fi film which use the clich of there be some connect between eqypt and alien . in a useless open sequenc , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyph on it . it wouldn't be till present day ( 94 ) till they would actual figur it out . they'r decipher ? a slightly-neurot scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( jame spader , do his best outsid of erot thriller and some indi fare ) who life suck so much that peopl walk out of his lectur after the third word . whi do they use him to deciph what no one els could ? so there is a hokey end ! duh ! he figur it out in about a minut . yea . and then they get a suicid colonel or someth , " jack " o'neil ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp lock in the begin then a flat-top that would make howi long snap into a fetal posit ) . whi a suicid colonel ? for the end ! you'll get the hang of this . they open the stargat , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anyth bad . after an overdon special effect thing , they'r . . . insid a goddam pyramid . so they went to egypt , right ? wrong . they'r on anoth planet that was film in egypt . they discov a cilvil rule by ra , the sun god ( the androgin jay davidson , with a voic modifi to make him sound like barri white with asthma ) , and there are fight , explos and a kiss between two peopl . yea . also melodrama , stupid , hokey scene and a bizarr languag . an anti-climact end end with stupid line ( " say hello to king tut , asswhol ! " - the quintessenti line , lemm tell ya ) and some conveni pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-charact develop . by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don't know , the " outer limit " or someth . the script terribl . the special effect are okay , but noth great . the stori so weak that it almost opaqu . the whole experi just isn't worth it unless you'r so bore that you'd consid watch a " full hous " marathon . . . or this . i'd pick this , obvious , but still , it just not fun at all . and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k .
0 the most interest part of " can't hard wait " just happen to be not onli the most human , but for mani of us , the one part that mani of us can easili relat to . that is the charact of denis ( lauren ambros ) , the film sole sarcast member who mock everyth that goe on in the film , and at one point sit down on a couch and look total bore . the film wise hold over this moment , nice show her alien in the midst of a larg high school parti . . . almost too nice . for some member of the audienc ( read : me ) , this is basic a mirror of what go on with them watch this film . we sit there wonder whi we'v even bother to see a film about a long high school parti we probabl never felt the desir to go to in the first place . i would actual high recommend this film if it satir all of this . after all , this film is fill with a bunch of pathet stereotyp much of which i went to high school with . everyon here : the jock , the homecom queen , the nerd ( and his dominion of trekki and x-phile ) , the alien wannab writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weird enough this film show them as superfici , lame , and basic as a bunch of loser . except for denis , who roll her eye at everyth , and easili becom the most likabl charact even befor she speak ( her yearbook entri , someth which is done for each main charact , quot oscar wild - definit pointer there ) . unfortun , the writer and director take sever major mistep on the way to make this into an admir and even likabl film . the film , as i said , portray most of it charact as superfici and just total ignor to everyth . howev , instead of stick with this , perhap even go a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actual make these charact into our hero . we follow sever of them , all a bunch of moron stereotyp with onli a shread of human and realism , and tri to tell bore and over melodramat tale about them as if we actual care and/or identifi with them . and if we did , we certain don't want to revisit that state of be . here a quick low-down : it graduat , and we follow a bunch of senior on the last night , otherwis known as the " american grafitti " or , to a lesser extent , the " daze and confus " clich . the formal just follow them as they drove aimless ; the latter did a littl bit of that and featur a big outdoor keg parti . " can't hard wait " just opt for a big indoor keg parti , and a littl bit of aimless drive , albeit of the i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-w brand . we follow mani peopl around , but most we trail preston ( ethan embri , of " that thing you do ! " ) , the alien writer , who been pine over the homcom queen , amanda ( the total overr jennif love hewitt ) , for the entireti of high school becaus he think they share a moment their freshman year over a freak pop tart . now that she broken up with her footbal player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decid to go to the parti with a note he written declar his " love " for her in the hope he'll build up the gut to give it to her . . . even though he leav for a multi-week intens write program host by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icki noxema spokesperson ? ) . sinc that plot is incred lame and a track record of what goe on with it wouldn't be abl to carri a commerci let alon a featur film , and becaus it a parti , there are some more main charact , such as : william ( charli korsmo , final surfac after " dick traci " ) , the nerd ( and his dominion ) who has come up with a ridicul plan to public sabotag mike , who humili him for year , but get too caught up in drink to do it ; kenni ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decid that this parti will be where he will final get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denis , the onli except charact , who unfortun get stuck in a bathroom ( don't ask ) with kenni where the two charact let down their charact and are allow to follow the law of plot clich from point a to point b with nari a bit of character involv after awhil . ugh . the main comparison this film is get to anoth film is actual not " american grafitti " or " daze and confus , " two film that embrac and ultim made human out of mani of it high schooler ( not to mention were extrem entertain ) , but to john hugh film of the 80s , most notabl " sixteen candl . " the big differ in the two is that that film manag to not onli embrac but even satir it main charact , and did so equal and in an entertain fashion . this film forget to satir it charact , and ultim tell a stori about a bunch of uninterest stereotyp . . . and then say that it all okay . we can't take this film serious , nor can we take this as fun , so realli what good is it ? but i will tell you some thing i did like : i like the direct , except for a coupl too-over-the-top featur , like way-too-glossi jump cut ( it like an oxymoron ) and other obscur . general , though , elfont and kaplan do have grace camera movement , and even manag to captur an altman-esqu feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to realli be admir ) . i actual did like seth green , for onc in about a decad ( when he play a veri young woodi allen in " radio day " ) - his desintegr of his wigger charact was almost believ . . . almost . and , of cours , lauren ambros is wonder as denis , the one charact we could have use some more of , even though it would have chang the entireti of the film . howev , the charact of denis realli doesn't work with the film , when realli thought about . she far too witti and realiz ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenev she appear , she automat give everyth a delight satir tone . she not just the cynic or the intellectu ; she just a veri interest charact who provid entertain even if it further damag other alreadi damag charact . she may ruin the film more , but at least when she on screen we can sit up and think to ourselv " well , at least we'll be entertain . " a coupl other thing that just don't work : mike charact , who suffer an epiphani throughout the film but in the end act as though he has forgotten everyth : too much the sacrifici lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchi drive by preston to tri and get over his inabl to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhap the one thing that just doesn't work at all : jenna eflman uncredit cameo as an angel - just didn't work , but nice tri . basic the worst thing about this film , the real reason i'm give this such a low rate , is becaus it refus to give us ani fulli realiz charact and then insist we follow around complet stereotyp from other movi do thing that are inan and unlik anyth we'd do . we don't feel for these charact becaus for most of us , we aren't stereotyp go through the motion to worn subplot . the acid test for high school movi is : doe it at all captur the feel of what it portray ? the answer for this film is no . nice tri , though .
1 gere , willi , poitier chase each other around the world the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman when the soviet union implod , the western countri lost their shadow . with the unit state friend with the russian , we no longer had an entiti to blame for the world problem . this show up in hollywood film as the communist govern was no longer the easi bad guy . it time to rejoic becaus we'v found our new villain . now it no longer the russian govern who send killer out into foreign land , it the russian _mafia_ . a perfect solut , it combin the dread of organ crime and the still-pres uneasi with the former eastern block countri . best of all , the villain are still foreign : fear of the other alway play best . so it is a crime lord in moscow that send legendari hitman the jackal ( bruce willi ) to assassin a high place us govern figur in retali for the death of his brother dure a nightclub raid . the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someon they'r not sure even exist . come to their rescu is former ira oper declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarili releas from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( dian venora ) . mulqueen ex-girlfriend basqu terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the onli person who has seen the elus jackal . ( presum there is an exclus intern terrorist club somewher where the three met . ) the film follow two parallel track as the jackal prepar for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempt to locat him while preston make sure that the irishman doesn't slip away . cross numer border and don various disguis for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is alway one step ahead of his pursuer . be veri loos base on the same book the 1973 thriller " the day of the jackal " , comparison between the two film is inevit . there is no doubt that the origin is the better movi , play the stori for suspens rather than the current action/adventur . as a mysteri , " the jackal " has enough hole in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there entertain to be had . hole ? let see ? a pivot clue for mulqueen is so obscur that he must possess psychic power to pick it up . for a 20-year veteran that can command the big buck , the jackal is an incred poor shot . the final scene between gere and willi occur in a locat that should be mob with polic , but it just the two of them . willi disguis usual look like bruce willi and are just as interest as val kilmer in " the saint " . ( and lest you misunderstand , that not a compliment . ) but the three star are fun to watch . it good to see gere in someth other than a busi suit . willi has a mix histori in pick project , but his charact are alway watchabl . poitier is by far the superior actor , but has limit screen time . the problem in logic are flaw , but don't ruin the experi . occasion there are movi that transcend their blemish . this is one of them .

0 isn't it the ultim sign of a movi cinemat ineptitud when you can't think of much to say about it other than " it suck " ? one of the first offici year 2000 releas , supernova is such a movi . i can't seem to get past one-word adject with this one , although " bore , " " stupid " and " absurd " doesn't amount to much of a review . a shame . i would have been abl to save myself the chore of desper tri to elabor . but c'est la vie . here goe noth . i'll keep it short . i suppos the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hour ) remov his name from the movi , request that it be replac with the pseudonym thoma lee . the film fate was seal in mani mind when struggl studio mgm declin to screen it for the press , an event usual signifi a studio lack of confid in a particular movi . hill and mgm action were prudent . when the captain of medic space vessel nightingal die in a tragic hyperjump accid , a reform drug addict who is also the first offic , for some reason ( jame spader ) is forc to take command . the ship pick up a distress call from a nearbi planet and , on arriv , pick up one survivor from an appar accid in an abandon mine coloni . one of the crew member ( angela bassett ) know this passeng , who is play by peter facinelli , and has some bad feel about it -- and we all know what that mean . this intergalact hitchhik is carri some mysteri cargo -- a jellylik substanc the purpos of which is unknown , though it seem to bring some form of pleasur to whoever touch it . anoth one of the crew member experi this first hand ; after spend a few minut partial insid this glob of goo , he doe some impress handstand pushup . evid , touch this enigmat egg-shap thingi make you younger and stronger . how ? whi ? the movi never bother to explain . soon enough though , spader and bassett are run around the ship like mad , be chase by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman facinelli . to be honest , i don't even rememb exact whi . i just rememb that i didn't care . supernova plot suggest some more or less interest idea , such as the ball of goo be an intergalact time bomb , but they are all drop befor they have a chanc to develop into anyth truli intrigu . in fact , everyth is drop just so the actor can have some fun run around what look like an elabor set . well , the effect are good , though there hard a studio movi with bad special effect these day so i'm not sure whether that so remark an accomplish . the perform are hard worth talk about . i'm not even sure i can call what here " perform , " though angela bassett sure is good at give peopl the finger . jame spader is not a bad actor , but he prove to be one of the blandest action star i'v seen in a while , most becaus he isn't given a charact with a person . the action scene are just as bland , sinc they'r pretti much just rehash of action element that weren't particular entertain the first time around . and sinc the action scene are everyth to this movi , it pretti much dead in the water . and for the life of me , i can't figur out whi it call supernova .
0 the live of older peopl in the twilight of their year attempt to come to grip with their share histori and possibl futur is a fascin topic . find an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . combin all that with a three-tim oscar-win director ( robert benton of " kramer vs . kramer " ) and creat a decid mediocr movi is the stuff of disappoint . in yet anoth noir mysteri set in hollywood -- how mani of these have we seen dure the past few year ? -- the atmospher is moodi , the actor enjoy to watch and the stori goe nowher . over-70 harri ross ( paul newman ) is a wash up cop-turned-priv eye-turn man friday tri to figur out how to live what remain of his life . he screw up thing pretti well ( " i had a wife and daughter . now , i'm a drunk ) and is at a crossroad . a coupl of year ago , he travel to mexico to bring back mel ( rees witherspoon ) , the under-ag daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherin ( susan sarandon ) ame and now live with them . the ame are former movi star , past their prime and the three have becom fast friend . one get the impress that ross is just hang out wait for someth to wake him up . to fill his time , he doe odd job for jack and fall in love with catherin . jack is in even wors shape than harri . he die of cancer with onli a year to live . thing do turn more excit when jack ask harri to drop off a seal manila envelop for him . instead of the routin errand that ross expect , he walk into a barrag of bullet from the gun of anoth ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloodi hole . this unsettl event give the former detect a project to throw himself into and launch an investig that revolv around the mysteri disappear of catherin first husband 20 year befor . through a seri of veri complex and convolut plot devic that involv murder ; blackmail ; gun ; mel mexico travel partner and his parol offic ; ross former cop buddi , ex-lov and would-b sidekick , the tale final end up exact where everyon expect it to . it a film noir tradit that the stori twist and turn down side road for an unexpect final , but here the journey meander toward an end that no one care about . the onli surpris are exact whose face fit which role in the scenario . by the time they show you , it doesn't matter . the storylin get goofier and goofier exemplifi in ross relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannab . these scene are obvious design to be comic relief , howev they are neither . rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it not explain or i didn't care enough at that point to rememb . a run joke about where harri was suppos shot while in mexico is probabl meant to mirror his question about whether he is still abl to perform . it also not funni , doesn't connect and keep on show up long after it has run it cours . on the posit side , it often enjoy to watch the season actor on the screen . the three lead all have well-deserv academi award and turn in accomplish , if not extraordinari job . newman is a grand actor , but doesn't seem quit suit to the dark film style . he is a bit too clean and underst to come across as desper and down and out . hackman , also low-key , is believ but lack sparkl . sarandon come across well as an sultri older babe although she is one-dimension . the actor do what they can with lame dialog , but they can't pull the film out of the hole it dug for itself . jame garner who play ross old buddi ex-cop raymond hope is alway a treat , but even he half-heart struggl through line like " i'm glad they didn't shoot your pecker off . " the best part of the film is the look at old friend , how their relationship chang over the year and the difficult choic they must make . the genuin easi and casual interact among the actor hint that be on the set was much more interest than what end up on the screen the film doesn't run veri long befor the audienc realiz that it hopeless . the onli reason for watch is the actor . it remind me of disast movi such as " tower inferno " where the star power is suppos to make everyon ignor the film problem . in a better world , there would have been second-r actor in this second-r movi and the one here would have been save for someth better . of cours , we don't live in that better world , but you could make your a littl nicer by choos a differ movi .
0 all right , all right , we get the point : despit all similar to the best-sel stori , speechless is * not * base on the romanc between 1992 presidenti campaign rival jame carvill and mari matalin . in fact , the script was in develop well befor 1992 . still , the comparison are inevit , until one realiz a critic differ . no , it not that the speechless twosom are speech writer , not campaign manag ; it that carvill and matalin stori is actual interest . speechless is a limp , poor structur would-b romant comedi . speechless is set dure a new mexico senatori campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davi ) meet and get romant one night when neither one can sleep . what neither one realiz is that they are on opposit side of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candid speech , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democrat candid . at first each one believ that the other has an ulterior motiv for the relationship , but eventu they let down their guard and becom closer . but there are plent of obstacl in the way , includ julia stud-report fianc ( christoph reev ) and a seri of stunt which continu to prove that all fair in love and polit . the standard formula for a movi like speechless would have the two principl start out as antagonist and realiz onli at the end that they'r crazi about each other . screenwrit robert king complet subvert expect by throw kevin and julia into each other arm in the first fifteen minut , then develop the antagon . it a nobl attempt to shake thing up , but unfortun it just doesn't work . part of the fun of watch spar in a romant comedi come from recogn the chemistri even befor the charact do , but in speechless they alreadi know they'r attract to each other , and we'r left with wait for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other alreadi . there is such a herky-jerki feel to the constant bicker and make up that even king sharp dialogu can't prevent speechless from becom repetit after about half an hour . inconsist is also the defin characterist of the perform of geena davi and michael keaton , and with those perform most of their scene togeth . the problem begin with their initi courtship , which doe virtual noth to establish julia charact and mere establish that kevin is a wise-ass . davi is radiant beauti , and keaton is general entertain , but these charact are so plastic that noth that happen to them seem to matter one bit . in a coupl of scene , like a quiet moment sit at a fountain , they actual achiev some measur of connect . for the most part , howev , they'r just actor spout line . you keep wait for a littl spark , and it never happen . perhap most disappoint is that king and director ron underwood complet wast their premis by remov all the punch from speechless polit . the set seem perfect for a high- energi battl of the sex with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that never the tone that underwood is go for . he want a warm , fuzzi romanc compat with marc shaiman flute-and-wind music score , and the campaign which should have defin the conflict between kevin and julia fade into the background . it might as well have been a stori about rival grocer , and everi singl charact is about as uninspir as he or she could possibl be . i was about the onli review in the civil world who seem to enjoy robert king previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hope for speechless . but while there is wit in the word , this is a script which was probabl much better on paper . on screen , it still paper thin .
0 and i thought " stigmata " would be the worst religiously-ori thriller releas this year . turn out i was wrong , becaus while " stigmata " was mere bore and self-import , " end of day " is complet inept on all front . it a silli , incomprehens , endless stupid mess . for a guy like me who grew up watch arnold schwarzenegg at his best , it extrem disconcert to see where the big man has end up . for the first time in recent memori , an arnold action movi ( and " batman & robin " doesn't count ) is no fun at all . " end of day " is a major stinker . the movi open in vatican citi , 1979 . some cathol priest have observ an ancient propheci , which say that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have target for impregn . if he impregn her between 11 and midnight on decemb 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroy . the pope order protect of this girl , though some priest believ she ought to be kill . in new york , that veri night , a girl is born to fulfil the propheci . twenti year later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegg ) , a suicid ex-cop with a drink problem . now work as a secur guard for hire , he is protect a local businessman ( gabriel byrn ) , who is actual possess by the devil . an assassin attempt on the businessman by a craze former priest lead him to the girl satan is after , christin york ( robin tunney ) . recogn element of his own murder daughter in christin ( includ ownership of the same music box , appar ) , jericho swear to protect her against the devil and the faction of priest look to kill her . there are so mani problem with this film it hard to know where to begin , but how about start with the concept ? cast arnold in a role like this was a mistak to begin with . schwarzenegg is a persona , not an actor , so put him in a role that contradict his usual strong person is a bad idea . arnold has neither the dramat rang nor the speak abil to pull off a charact torment by conflict emot . in other word , tri to give him dimens was a mistak . harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willi could have play this role ( they'v all play nobl and flaw hero ) , but not schwarzenegg . there are sever scene that attempt to establish jericho charact ; one has him contempl suicid , anoth cri over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tri to tempt him into reveal christin locat by offer him his old life back . none of these scene realli work , becaus arni isn't up to the task . the filmmak would have been better off make jericho a strong , confid charact ( like the termin , for exampl ) , the like of which schwarzenegg has excel in befor . this one isn't at all believ the way arnold play him . the support cast tri their hardest , and onli gabriel byrn make ani impact at all . as the princ of dark , he suav and confid . he act like one would expect the devil to act . the problem is that the script has him do thing that make no sens ( more on that later ) and that undermin him as a power villain . byrn out-perform arnold in everi scene they have togeth ( includ the aforement temptat bit ) , but this is problemat when it caus the audienc to start do the unthink : root for the devil . byrn speech about the bibl be " overr " actual start to make sens , main becaus arnold attempt at refut it ( most of the " tis not ! " varieti ) are feebl at best . the onli problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobodi realli care . kevin pollack play jericho secur guard sidekick and tri to liven thing up with some comic asid , but like most bad action movi sidekick , he disappear after about an hour . robin tunney isn't given much to do except look scare . in fact , all of the support player are good actor , but none , save for byrn , is given anyth interest to do . perform asid , it would be realli hard to enjoy this film no matter who star in it . this be an action blockbust , it no surpris that the worst thing about it is the script , which start off total confus , and when some of it is explain ( and not much of it is ) , it utter ridicul . whi is the devil come on new year eve , 1999 ? becaus it exact 1000 year after the year of the devil , which isn't 666 , it turn out . some nutti priest accident read it upsid down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the begin , and you'v got 1999 ! if you don't buy this explan , you'r not alon . it convolut and silli at the same time . the method by which jericho locat christin york is equal ludicr ( she christin , see , and she live in new york , see . . . ) , and if that weren't bad enough , there plenti of bothersom stuff in this film that isn't explain at all . whi can satan kill everyon he pass on the street , but when it come to snuf out one drunk ex-cop , he powerless ? is he impervi to onli one kind of bullet ? how come he can't control jericho or christin ? and how did those gregorian monk deal with time zone in their propheci ? a clumsi attempt at a joke is made about this , but it never actual explain . usual , this sort of thing wouldn't matter in a schwarzenegg flick ( i mean , don't get me start on the time paradox offer up by the termin movi ) , but this time the plot inconsist stand out even more than usual becaus the action is rare excit . there are sever predict horror film clich ? s present in " end of day , " complet with the old " black cat hide in a cabinet " bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was do in there . it get so formula that it possibl for those uninterest in be scare to close their eye at the precis moment a " boo " will come . their predict will rare be wrong . the more grandios action sequenc are utter charmless , partial becaus we don't care about these charact ( due to the script pathet attempt at character and setup ) , and also becaus they , too , don't make ani sens . there a scene where schwarzenegg get thrown around a room by a littl old ladi . it good for a few chuckl , but not much els . suppos we'r to believ she now has super strength by virtu of be control by satan , but the script never set that up , so the scene is mere silli . none of this is terribl excit , becaus all the action sequenc are so bad frame that it often hard to tell whi it happen in the first place , not to mention that they'r edit in full-on incomprehens mtv quick-cut style . most of them had me scratch my head , rather than say , " wow , cool ! " " end of day " is not onli silli and confus , but it also distinct unpleas to watch . the devil appar doesn't oper in the more subtl , i'll-convince-people-to-kill-each-oth fashion outlin in the bibl , but instead enjoy kill peopl gruesom in broad daylight . this doesn't onli make him an aw predict sort , but it also mean that not a singl scene in " end of day " goe by without unnecessarili graphic violenc , or the odd kinki sexual encount ( yet anoth bit that had me scratch my head ) . if violenc is suppos to be shock , it not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movi that the audienc goe numb . scene aren't connect through ani reason mean , so a lot of the time , stuff get blown up , or peopl get kill , and i had no idea whi . reason ? to hell with reason ! let just blow stuff up ! isn't it cool ? nope , not by a long shot . this film is thorough unwatch . it dull , intermin , and unrel in it stupid . perhap arnold need to make some movi with jame cameron to reviv his career , becaus it not happen with hack peter hyam here . " end of day " might have had camp valu , if onli it didn't top itself off with an over pious end that nobodi go to buy . if the movi is go to be serious , the filmmak should have come up with a decent script . if it go to be campi , arnold shouldn't be take himself so damn serious ( i didn't actual see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his charact shouldn't be such a sad sack . as it stand , " end of day " is just a bad movi , and an aw gloomi one at that .
0 bat is this year camp flick . with the world worst dialogu , cheesiest premis and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy film humor in their inan . as for the rest of us , well . . . i'd say skip it , but look at the box offic figur for this one , it seem as though most of america is follow that advic anyway . follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minut of your life and 8 buck to boot . i love alfr hitchcock the bird , almost as much as i love the short stori on which it is base . it sadden me even more , then , to see that american treasur rip off so blatant by wannab horror/schlock such as bat . when mysteri bat attack occur in a small texa town , the author call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investig . it turn out that a creepi scientist ( bob gunton ) has genet enhanc a coupl bat that escap from his lab , make them smarter and more vicious . whi has he done this , you ask ? becaus , you see , it is appar a scientist job to make thing " a littl better , " even if that mean the death of all mankind . so the batologist , her wisecrack sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillip ) have to kill all the bat and save the world . of cours , that can't happen befor they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uniniti ) , get up close and person with some truli repuls fli mammal and surviv some of the dumbest situat ever seen in a profession produc motion pictur . consid , for exampl , a scene where two peopl are in a bat cave . the bat are all sleep , but the human are afraid they might wake up befor they can get out . what do they do ? do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ? nope . they stand there for a while , transfix by the thousand of bat open their eye . what keep bat from be scari or creepi is the hyperact edit in most of the attack scene . we don't even get to see what go on ; the screen becom a mush becaus the cut are so quick . all we know is that bat are attack . how they are attack and what exact is happen remain a mysteri . a littl technic profici doe wonder for horror movi , and bat sure could use some . of cours , director loui morneau tri to liven thing up with some intent humor , but it is so convent it doesn't realli go anywher . most of the ocmic relief come courtesi of the batologist wisecrack sidekick ( leon ) , who take everi opportun to sputter ingeni line like " i hate bat ! " some of these are so bad that they take on a doubl qualiti : they may inspir a smirk by their veri natur and a roar laugh becaus they are so inept . i hate charact who exist for the sole purpos of spout lame one-lin . play such charact doe not help actor career . still , i suppos that if you'r look for a movi that is " so bad it good , " you could do wors than bat . it doe have a tremend amount of camp valu . i'm not " recommend " the movi becaus , quit frank , it suck , and i know that this might convinc some peopl to go out and see it . more power to them .
1 while alex brown ( devon sawa ) wait at jfk to leav for a school trip to pari , bad omen seem to surround him . as soon as he buckl into the plane , he has a vision of the plane explod second after take-off . when the vision begin to come true , alex bolt for the door , drag sever student and a teacher in his wake . the plane take off without them and explod just as alex predict . he becom an object of fear and suspicion among the communiti , and the tension onli increas as the survivor begin to die . alex and anoth survivor , clear river ( ali larter ) , investig the suspici " suicid " of a friend , and a mortician ( toni " candyman " todd ) clue them in to the truth : alex interrupt death design by save peopl who should have die in the explos , and death will want to claim it right victim . in order to save himself and the other , alex will have to figur out death new plan and thwart it . of the countless horror film that have compet for a piec of the " scream " audienc , " final destin " is the best so far . talent young screenwrit jeffrey reddick offer a fresh variat on a familiar formula . we'v seen hundr of movi where a group of teenag are murder one-by-on by a faceless slasher , but reddick cut out the hockey-mask middle-man and make the villain death itself . first-tim featur director jame wong made the most of that premis . everi scene is permeat with creepi and forebod , remind us that death is everywher , can come at anytim . everyday object and event vibrat with menac . the most amus harbing of doom : john denver " rocki mountain high , " which is play sever time in the movi befor someon die . ( the link is that denver die in a plane crash , and the song includ a line about fire in the sky . ) the perform are stronger than those usual elicit by teen horror . devon sawa , who previous star in anoth horror flick , " idl hand , " give a frantic and convinc lead perform . kerr smith is carter hogan , an antagonist of alex whose quick temper caus him to pull off the fatal plane . smith play carter as fill with anger and confus that constant threaten to bubbl over into violenc . seann william scott , who also in theater right now in " road trip , " play the somewhat dim billi hitchcock and provid a need counterpoint to the intens of alex and carter . toni todd one-scen cameo is delici but all too brief . bottom line : watchabl teen fright flick are few and far between , but this destin is worth visit .
0 if you'v been follow william fichtner career ( and there absolut no reason whi you should have ) , you might have notic that he play some rather similar role over the year . like sulli in " the perfect storm " --tough , gruff , and a littl bit scari . or law in " albino allig " --tough , gruff , and littl bit scarier . or colonel william sharp in " armageddon , " or dwayn engelman in " strang day , " or even his brief appear toward the begin of " pearl harbor , " as the abus father of danny--her is an actor who gravit toward tough , gruff , hard-hit role . which is whi his perform in " what the worst that could happen ? " is such a shock , such a delight . in the film , fichtner play a blond hair , meticul dress , overt effemin , dog-lov detect . as alex tardio , fichtner perform border on caricatur but goe beyond it . it border on offens but doesn't realli manag it . and it border on clich ? d stereotyp but doesn't quit succumb to that definit either . in a role so diametr oppos to what the actor has play befor we should have seen it come , fichtner isn't perfect--you can see him struggl a littl at time , concentr a littl too hard on the look as he swish his hand through the air , or nuzzl a coif canin up close and personal--but he pretti damn good , and silli , and without question the best thing in the film . in fact , had it not been for fitchner sudden and bizarr appear , and his jar screen presenc thereaft , i would have walk out , for " what the worst that could happen ? " is mesmer in it aw , a poor written , haphazard edit , and total unfunni ( yes , it star martin lawrenc and danni devito so how could that be possibl ? ) moviego experi . fichtner perform doesn't exact save the film , and it not like i'm recommend " what the worst that could happen ? " sole on the strength of the actor dramat turnaround , but his contribut do rais the film rate from no star to one-and-a-half . thumb up to fichtner then , and thumb down--way , way , down--to everyon els involv in this sorri mess , a movi so dull and pedestrian and nonsens it doesn't even warrant discuss .

" tswsm was film in southern california , but was suppos to take place in england . i can tell you one thing- he is have a lot of fun with this enorm popular charact , which is all over televis , newspap , magazin , and the movi theater . i believ that dr . evil got more attent in the tswsm than austin power did . dr . evil provid more laugh , more memor moment , and more interest dialogu than austin did this time around , who seem to miss the funni touch that he had in the first film . i felt that austin realli did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myer , not fat bastard . also make a great addit to the seri is mini me , who is play by vern troyer . even though the midget actor is 30 year old , he is ador by dr . evil side constant . the first austin power film had bare ani sentiment qualiti , such as lack of charact develop , bare ani detail plot characterist , and bare ani good act , but austin power tswsm actual show some qualiti behind the frequent humor . mike myer , with his three role , act as eddi murphi did in the nutti professor , disguis himself complet in one of the role . ( fat bastard ) all three charact are differ , and mike myer doe do a good job handl each one of them . heather graham made a great addit with her talent to tswsm , and doe a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a veri flat perform in the origin , speak her line without ani feel or emot . speak of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moment . hope , graham tag along for futur austin power adventur . the bottom line- a groovi sequel that mike myer put all of his mojo into write .
0 my first exposur to the nightmar on elm street seri of film was not this one , but in fact the third instal ( it was the first to gain a nation theatric releas ) . i didn't see the first film until much later . so look back , the origin didn't hold a lot of great memori for me , sinc i didn't think too much of it when i initi saw it . watch it now for a second time confirm that it an overr horror film that ultim make no sens whatsoev . you all know the stori by now : child murder freddi krueger ( robert englund ) return from the grave by haunt the dream of the children of those who burn him aliv year befor . this first instal doe an adequ job with it low budget , but there some absurd dialogu and conceptu problem with the stori . plus the movi end ( understand the result of the studio want the end of the film to have a " hook " for a sequel ) render the rest of the film pointless . and doe anyon understand what happen to nanci mother at the end of this film ? don't get me wrong though . . . it not as if a new generat of horror film have spurn me away from the classic . most horror movi releas today are just as inan as this film is . horror is a difficult genr to pull off credibl , and a nightmar on elm street just doesn't cut it . a nightmar on elm street is avail on dvd from new line home video . it is avail both as a singl disc and as part of the nightmar on elm street collect box set . the film is present in both pan and scan and it origin theatric aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that come in the box set , onli a widescreen transfer is provid ) . the film has been digit remast and includ two option for audio : a mono mix and a new dolbi digit 5 . 1 mix . also includ on the dvd is a full-length audio commentari track with writer/director wes craven , star john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film director of photographi . other extra includ the " jump to a nightmar " featur ( i'm sure you can figur that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bio ( which are from the film origin press releas kit , and notabl leav out robert englund and johnni depp ! ) , and the film origin theatric trailer . some dvd-rom featur are also includ , but sinc i don't have dvd-rom capabl i can't realli get into that . the commentari track is entertain and inform , but noth spectacular . the first thing of note is that it the same commentari track that was on the special edit laserdisc from a few year ago . i'm not say that a negat thing , just point it out . everyon seem enthusiast about be there , with the possibl except of john saxon , who just doesn't say much at all . most of the time you'll forget he even there . everyon els talk realli quiet though for some reason , as if becaus they'r comment on a scari movi that they need to stay as quiet as possibl . the bonus disc with the box set call the nightmar seri encyclopedia featur about 45 minut worth of interview relat to the first film of the seri . also includ is the origin theatric trailer and two altern end to the film . . . howev you can onli access one easili . the other is hidden in what call " the labyrinth " , which might possibl be the most annoy featur of a dvd ever creat . basic , it an interact game of sort where you wander through differ nightmar locat look at object which give you access to extra littl snippet of footag , interview , etc . somewher in the labyrinth is the second altern end to the film . find it though is both a chore and a bore .

0 long ago , film were construct of strong dialogu , origin charact , memor plot point , and solid act . one of the best exampl that hollywood now complet ignor these qualiti is found in the new film where the heart is . this opus about the power of love and the redempt of famili follow the tragic , and i mean tragic , life of novale nation ( natali portman ) . hit the road with her hick , guitar-play boyfriend in a rusted-out gm , novale dream of the blue sky of bakersfield and sip chocol milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn babi , due in a month . stop off at a nearbi wal-mart for a quick rest , novale boyfriend decid to take off and leav her there . novale then decid to secret hole up in the wal-mart ( becaus she not the brightest bulb in the stagelight ) . a wacki librarian ( keith david ) come to her rescu when she goe into labor one night while she is camp in the outdoor section of the store . then the she move in with a famili , befriend everyon in town -- includ ashley judd charact ( who has five kid and still can work part-tim as a nurs ) -- fight off religi freak , surviv a tornado , break the heart of the wacki librarian that save her , receiv an inherit , build a martha stewart-esqu hous , becom an award-win photograph , and manag to alway look like she step out of a cosmo shoot , all while not onc do anyth with her kid . this film is terribl . the direct is aw : it seem director matt william had an index card with six angl written on it and use everi one of them , over and over and over again . we get pathet and ugli act by natali portman , who can do good work . a disjoint pace of key scene and a time structur so confus that it would throw steve prefontain off . a subplot that actual valid the action of the boyfriend who abandon novale in the wal-mart park lot . an embarrass display of emot by the charact , make the audienc ill . take two great comed screenwrit , babaloo mandel and lowel ganz , and forc them to write drama on par with oprah book club . altogeth , it has the feel of be trap at home , watch a veri bad televis mini-seri and wish it to end , onli the remot is broken . howev , the main problem with the film is that it never answer the most poignant question brought up : where is the heart ? no one ever seem to find it in this piec of junk .
0 brian de palma snake eye star nicola cage evil twin , who confus use the same stage name as his talent brother . like a foreign tourist who scream his line in english to ensur that he will be understood , cage yell with the feroc of a man with a bad case of caffein overload . de palma , whose last great film , the untouch , was craft over a decad ago seem to have lost his magic . in snake eye , he manag to elicit some of the worst perform possibl out of a skill cast . onli gari sinis rise slight abov the hackney materi . the rest of the actor becom caricatur in this by-the-numb thriller . ryuichi sakamoto atmospher and melodramat music domin almost everi scene . heavi on the long violin note , it rhythm is punctuat by thunder .

0 there'r so mani thing to critic about i don't know where to start . recommend : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreas the rate everyday becaus i think about it too much . a comet is about to strike earth , caus a catastroph similar to the extinct level event ( e . l . e . ) that wipe out the dinosaur . what follow is the stori of a presid bid to think for the good of his peopl , a rise report , the love stori of two teenag ( one of whom discov the comet ) , and a team of astronaut on the ship `messiah to save the world . first , there is noth outstand inferior about the make of the film ( nor is there anyth outstand good about it ) , but the plot hole make the film corni and stupid . to be honest , i was more move by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't say much ) . mimi leder follow-up to `the peacemak is equal incompet , with all the big star wast . ( perhap i'm just annoy that the releas of `the peacemak in the us overshadow a far superior thriller , `the assign . ) it is veri obvious that the titl not onli repres the big boom that will result from the collis , but also connot the heavi impact on human live . howev , the film simpli fail on that note . the effect are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limit the act , and the director continu her sad run in term of good-film-mak credenti . she still make good money though . t ? a leoni unfortun charact , the news report , is the foundat of the stori and of the cast . but the film suffer from too mani charact that do not need to be explor . robert duval age astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman presid is restrict to , well , a righteous presid ( which mean he not interest at all ) . leoni charact is the onli appeal one , and is play with reason convict ( but a rather peculiar show when report for msnbc ) , but was definit undervalu by the director and screenwrit . warn : spoiler includ ( but a lot of it is irrelev and predict anyway ) . plot hole , plot hole , plot hole . now , e . l . e . is threaten to extermin more than 99% of the human race , and they send eight puni littl nuclear bomb up there ? where the logic ? leder could have at least made it plausibl with 20 . and then it turn out that onli a few percent of the world popul actual perish , and those less selfish one ( the one that stay at home ) were the victim . the film was almost mock them , tell them they had die for noth . i also fail to see how two teenag , carri a babi , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hil , even with a motorbik for a head-start . it unlik that the dust will take just two year to settl , but that doesn't realli matter . build cave was a strategi mention in `dr . strangelov , which propos that peopl live underground for one hundr or so year . now that is a more practic use for cave . what is the point of live in cave ? there is no , unlik `dr . strangelov , ani radioact outsid to restrict exposur . how do plant grow ? if human have the technolog to keep plant aliv in cave , there no reason whi they can't do it in the open . the presid disclos that other countri have been prepar their own cave . obvious this mean that the other countri were inform a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobodi leak the news to the media . in an import mission like that of the `messiah , for that matter ani mission , it is imposs that isn't suffici fuel for an extra coupl of hundr metr , needless to say ten of kilometr . this is not deep impact ? it a frivol cheap impact . but even with all that , some overact , and a 3 . 4 rate , it still watchabl , just don't think about it . okay ?

0 depend on your degre of cinemat acumen , last man stand is either a ) a prohibition-era remak of akira kurosawa 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remak of sergio leon 1964 classic a fist of dollar ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a complet origin story-lin . new line is certain count on the fact that there are far more potenti viewer in categori ( c ) than in the other two combin , much as the recent remak of diaboliqu and the vanish count on avoid such comparison . the fact is that there is yet anoth way of look at last man stand , which is as the first film version of the stori which nod to the _real_ sourc materi , the dashiel hammett novel _red harvest_ . it also show that kurosawa and leon knew better what to do with that materi than hammett himself . this time around , the man with no name is play by bruce willi , a fellow with a shadi histori of an undefin natur who roll into the texa border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . by all appear , jericho is well on it way to becom a ghost town , with the few remain inhabit general belong to one of two bootleg oper fight for control of liquor come over the border . one is head by an irishman name doyl ( david patrick kelli ) ; the other is run by chicago-connect italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . call himself john smith , the man decid that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hire himself out as an enforc to doyl side . but smith allegi is as uncertain as his name , and he begin to play the two side against each other while tri to stay one step ahead of both of them . viewer familiar with both previous incarn of this stori will find virtual noth radic chang from a plot standpoint , and that alon should make last man stand somewhat more respect than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastard . there is the happili ineffectu lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappili detain object of one of the boss affect ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becom our anti-hero onli friend ( william sanderson ) , suspici lieuten ( christoph walken and michael imperioli ) to question the boss trust in smith , a brutal beat , and a big fire . director walter hill give the proceed his usual inject of steroid , includ a pair of gun for willi which have the abil to propel an assail backward with suffici thrust to achiev escap veloc , but at least he doesn't tri to turn the stori into a slasher film or a buddi pictur . what he _does_ do is near as big a mistak , and that is to provid a run voice-ov narrat by willi which ring of the standard hard-boil style of pulp detect fiction . yes , that narrat is full of clich , but those are are not particular troubl . the problem is that both yojimbo and a fist of dollar succeed larg on the inscrut of their lead charact . they were a mysteri , to the other charact in the film and to the audienc , their motiv never entir clear even after they have act , and that qualiti contribut to their almost mythic status . with john smith voic chatter on in the background and allow us into his everi thought , he becom more mundan , just anoth tough guy tri to stay aliv . it feel like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faith to his text for his choic , but it simpli doesn't work . the narrat allow the man with no name to take us into his confid , and the man with no name take _no one_ into his confid . even if you walk into last man stand as a blank slate , i can't imagin it be much more than a heavili arm minor distract . willi tone down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he alway seem like he is count on be tougher than everyon els rather than smarter than everyon els . christoph walken play doyl brutal henchman as a slight variat on his galleri of soft-spoken psycho , and there isn't anoth singl charact whom make even the slightest impress . with no compel antagonist for smith , there is no build-up toward the expect showdown , and when it doe come , that showdown is over so quick you wonder what all the fuss was about . cinematograph lloyd ahern ( who also did the onli noteworthi work on hill 1995 flop wild bill ) creat some nifti sunburn vista , but his work is onli to keep the eye distract between the spurt of gunfir and the next bit of counter-product narrat . sometim when someon see a lacklust remak of a rever origin , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . in the case of last man stand , it is those who know the origin who will wonder what all that talk was about .
1 contact ( pg ) there a moment late in robert zemecki contact where i was remind of whi i start write movi review in the first place . we see a scientist , dress in a silveri space suit , walk tentat across a narrow walkway lead insid a compact , spheric space pod , unawar of what await when the ball liter drop . anticip , excit , anxieti , fear--th audienc experi it all the emot tension right with the charact , nervous , breathless eager to see what lie ahead . it is this sens of discoveri , the anticip of which and it accompani exhilar , that make this adapt of the carl sagan novel such magic , captiv entertain . jodi foster star as dr . elli arroway , a brilliant astronom who dedic her entir life to search outer space for extraterrestri radio signal . and i mean life--aft lose her entir famili when she was young , the onli thing occupi elli world is this quest to discov life beyond this earth . after deal with much skeptic on the part of govern offici and wealthi financi , elli receiv her vindic when she stumbl upon an incom radio transmiss from the distant star vega , which includ instruct on build an interstellar transport . from this synopsi , contact doe not sound too differ to most film about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intellig film than the sci-fi hook . the alien contact angl generat a great amount of suspens and awe , but perhap more than anyth els , contact is a charact studi of elli , whose obsess with empir , scientif evid has eras all belief in a higher power . the ironi is that , while admit to have no religi faith , she hold onto her belief in extraterrestri life with such passion and convict that it becom , in a sens , a religion in it own right . it would be easi for scripter jame v . hart and michael goldenberg , in tri to paint a posit imag of the heroin , to champion her scientif belief over religi one , but they wise eschew easi answer , give equal time to both side , and in so do depict elli as not complet sane . in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that come off more posit in the other , even slight so--ther are just two veri viabl point of view , each with their own merit , each with their own fault . the complex role of elli is an actress dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet anoth best actress oscar nomin next year , more than rise to the challeng . she convey intellig , determin , warmth , and , in a gutsi move , alway on edg . we root for elli and feel for her , but we also feel at time that she goe too far . contact is clear foster vehicl , but other are given their chanc to shine in smaller role . matthew mcconaughey , who receiv outrag high bill for his smallish role , hold his own as the religi counterpoint to elli , spiritu scholar and govern advis palmer joss ( howev , his main storylin , the tentat palmer-elli romanc , is the film weakest subplot ) . john hurt is effect creepi as s . r . hadden , the wealthi eccentr who provid elli with her research fund . angela bassett continu to impress in her bit role as white hous aid rachel constantin . most memor of all , though , are tom skerritt and jame wood , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and nation secur advis michael litz , respect ; both , especi skerritt , embodi these asshol charact that the audienc hiss just about everi singl one of their appear . zemecki come off of his three-year break in top shape . alway known as a director of effects-laden extravaganza , it come as no surpris that contact visual effect are quit stun . the central space journey is more than a littl reminisc of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanc technolog at his dispos , zemecki voyag is even trippier than stanley kubrick yet more wondrous pure . and zemecki doesn't resist the urg to use the always-interest incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footag effect , which is everi bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . effect , howev , are confin to onli a few scene and clear take a back seat to the drama , emot , and pure wonder , which zemecki prove to be quit adept at in gump . it say a lot that , in a summer scienc fiction film such as this , it not so much the effect that stay with you as it is the drama and the issu that are rais . the thought-provok , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcom chang of pace from summer no-brain , but the fact that it is a smart film doe not mean that it also isn't entertain . for all the interest question it ask , the film is still what it be sold as-- " a journey to the heart of the univers . " and what a fascin , unforgett journey it is .
1 it has been three long year sinc quentin tarantino stun the cinema world by claim the cann film festiv palm d'or , a $100 million-plus box offic gross , and an oscar nomin ? all for his sophomor outing , pulp fiction . sinc then , the talent film maker has been virtual invis , surfac briefli as a co-director of the wild uneven four room and the screenwrit of the gori vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . in between , he has moonlight as an " actor " with sever decid unmemor perform . now , with much fanfar and anticip , tarantino has return with his third directori effort , jacki brown . and , while this motion pictur , adapt from elmor leonard novel , rum punch , offer solid entertain , those expect anoth bravura outing from tarantino will leav theater disappoint . for the most part , jacki brown is a pretti ordinari crime movi . the stori , which start out slowli , develop into a twisti affair , with double-cross and triple-cross . and the movi is litter with occasion tarantino trademark : witti dialogu , unexpect gunfir , 70s pop tune , and close-up of women bare feet . yet , for all of that , the product is someth of a letdown . the sheer , in-your-fac exuber that mark reservoir dog and especi pulp fiction is absent . the mostly-straightforward chronolog of jacki brown doesn't match up favor to the non-linear style of tarantino previous effort ? an approach that ad tension and edgi to the narrat . and there aren't near as mani delici offbeat convers this time around . there a samuel l . jackson monologu about gun , a jackson/chri tucker argument regard the merit of hide in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchang that recal some of the jackson/travolta materi from pulp fiction , but that about it . jacki brown lone " innov " is it present of a crucial sequenc from three differ perspect . this isn't exact an origin techniqu ? it has been done numer time befor , most famous in akira kurosawa rashomon and most recent in edward zwick courag under fire . howev , while in those two movi ( and other ) , there was a legitim plot reason for the multipl points-of- view , tarantino sole purpos for use it appear to be becaus it unconvent . had the scene in question been shown from onli one of the three vantag , noth would have been lost . as a result , this aspect of the film is littl more than a curios . for the second pictur in a row , tarantino is attempt to reviv the career of a 70s icon . this time around , instead of john travolta , it blaxploit queen pam grier ( foxi brown has becom jacki brown ) . in one of mani nod to the most famous segment of grier career , tarantino use a 70s song to accompani her first appear dure the open credit . there are also sever instanc dure jacki brown when the director offer a sli wink toward certain convent of the blaxploit genr ( although grier never doe ani butt-kick ) . grier is jacki brown , a flight attend who get caught transport drug and money into the unit state . she work for gun dealer ordel robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keep her mouth shut under question , despit pressur from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a feder offici . no longer sure whether or not he can trust jacki , ordel arrang for a bail bondsman , max cherri ( robert forster , tv " banyon " ) to post the necessari $10 , 000 , then plan to shoot jacki if she prove disloy . jacki pass ordel test , howev , and soon the two of them are plot a way to smuggl $500 , 000 of ordel money into the unit state without tip off the fed . soon , just about everyon is after that money , includ jacki , max , ray , ordel perpetu oversex and drugged-out girlfriend , melani ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , loui ( robert de niro ) . unsurpris , the most memor perform is turn in by samuel l . jackson , but ordel isn't near as invigor or compel a charact as jule from pulp fiction . in addit to look fantast , pam grier is also quit good , although her is not an oscar- calib perform ( although she might get a nomin ) . robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile role . bridget fonda is around for three discern reason : to look sexi in a bikini , to provid a littl twist comedi , and to satisfi tarantino foot fetish . robert de niro is crimin underus in a part that could have been play equal well by ani grungy- look , middle-ag actor . the film , which clock in at sever minut over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probabl too long for the materi , but the plot is convolut enough to keep us guess throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . tarantino keep thing move along nice , with a heavier dose of humor and less violenc than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movi seem more like the work of one of his wannab than someth from the director himself . when it come to recent caper film ( like the grifter and bound ) , jacki brown is a second-ti effort . it an entertain divers , but not a masterpiec , and certain not an oscar contend .

1 uncompromis french director robert bresson " lancelot of the lake " achiev the exact opposit effect of sir thoma malori " mort darthur . " instead of enshrin the legend of king arthur and his knight of the round tabl , it dethron them by reveal arthur as a weak , ineffectu leader and the knight as a group of jealous , bicker men who fail to live up to the legend prescrib to them . chivalri has no place in " lancelot of the lake , " except as that of a die ideal . bresson begin his tale as the knight of the round tabl are return , decim , after fail merlin command to retriev the holi grail , the mystic cup that was fill with christ blood . bresson immedi give us his impress of the essenti mean of the grail quest : bloodsh and failur . the open sequenc is a seri of clumsi , disjoint fight amongst anonym knight -- a head is hack off , a stomach is impal , a skull is split open , skelet remain hang from tree , and burn bodi smolder in the ruin of a flame hous . sinc the film start with camelot in near-ruin , and take onli an hour and a half to arriv at it inevit conclus , it doesn't carri the grand , tragic reson of other arthurian film . we never get to see camelot at the peak of it power , therefor there is no real downfal to wit . but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evok in the titl of the film . rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interest in the intern battl within his heart , than the extern downfal of a kingdom . lancelot has alway been a tragic figur in the arthurian tale , and bresson use him as the central figur to explor the battl between the spirit and the flesh . the greatest of all knight , he was flaw onli in his love for arthur wife , queen guinever , and it was that illicit affair that eventu caus the downfal of camelot . even when lancelot attempt to end the affair with guinever ( laura duke condomina ) , he onli find himself fall back into her arm against his better judgment . he know it mean the destruct of the ideal kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . when sir mordr ( patrick bernhard ) accus lancelot of the affair , other knight , includ sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot defens . it is this battl within the knight that is the eventu undo of the round tabl ; the flesh win out over the spirit , and the consequ are dire . bresson is an intens person filmmak most interest in the interior of men heart and mind . " lancelot of the lake " is fill with his particular trademark : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogu , and a grand use of natur sound in place of music . he use background music onli twice in the film , dure an open narrat segment and dure the open credit . the music here is a heavi drumbeat and accompani bagpip , but the rest of the film is score with natur sound that punctuat the film themat element : the incess clank and creak of heavi armor , the neigh of hors , the rhythm of hoov beat down dirt road , and the natur chirp and whisper of the forest . like most of his other film , bresson employ nonprofession actor who recit the dialogu in emotionless , flat voic . all the actor he use in " lancelot of the lake " had never act befor , and with the except of patrick bernhard , they never act again . never onc do they rais their voic or put ani emphasi on a given word . instead of use vocal inflect , bresson strove to creat emot through imag . in some way , this techniqu work ; in other way , it doesn't . the final montag of arthur men battl each other is quit marvel , and the final imag of the knight in shine armor reduc to a liter scrap-pil sum up the entir film in one moment . howev , other time bresson uncompromis method are distract and question . for instanc , dure an import joust contest , bresson film the major of the action so that the onli thing visibl are the hors leg . he doe this repeat , open each shot with the same few note from a bagpip and the rais of a differ flag . while there might be symbol valu in this , the result experi of watch it can be bothersom . nevertheless , " lancelot of the lake " is a fascin cinemat experi bold made by a master filmmak . bresson style may not be for everyon , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . by re-evalu the arthurian legend and make them his own , he turn " lancelot of the lake " into someth rare in modern cinema : a truli person film .
1 note : some may consid portion of the follow text to be spoiler . be forewarn . jame toback return to direct after a eight-year layoff , two girl and a guy , is a film which is compris , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girl , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primari set ( blake absurd spacious bachelor apart ) , and a great deal of dialogu . embrac a near real-tim approach , this is a high theatric featur that complet hang upon the perform of it three actor and the qualiti of the dialogu written by mr . toback for his banter charact . fortun , the film cast is up to the challeng , and the wordi exchang between the triad of charact , while admit variabl , are occasion wick amus . the film setup is fair generic in natur , and open rather unpromis . we meet self-possess blond carla and feisti brunett lou , both wait outsid a soho loft . as they engag in idl chatter , it is reveal that they'r both wait for their respect boyfriend to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realis that they'r be two-tim by the same guy . more indign with him than catti with each other , the duo break into blake loft and await his arriv for a confront . it when blake return to his abod where the film hit it stride . play with magnific bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captiv dynam , bluster , and stealthi piec of work that burst onto the scene and rais the stake to new height . it fascin to watch this charact in his natur habitat , and perhap the film best choic was to have his two girlfriend scamper off into hide upon his return , allow us to size up blake not with his interact with other , but by his own innat behaviour . whether he flamboy behind his piano in a rollick rendit of vivaldi , or on the phone leav messag to his belov ( carla , lou , and his unseen sick mother ) , it never less than wild entertain and insight . though at this point i almost hope the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typic afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselv , and the spark begin to fli . ( one of the great touch in the film is how blake , when startl by carla unannounc appear , begin to both verbal and physic backped even befor he realiz that the cat out of the bag . ) double-team by the understand aggriev women ( who are more smirk inquisit than feroci veng -- they want a justif for his ongo hypocrisi ) , an increasingly-flust blake weak defend himself with apologet and even self-right declar against their verbal jab . surpris delight in the waltz of scath witti banter share by it trio of charact , two girl and a guy conclud it first sequenc with an unexpect apoplect act of such outrag audac that it seem noth was off-limit for this film . howev , it'd be unfeas to attempt to string along carla and lou outrag to full feature-length , and it as the movi gradual transform into the share of exploratori profund on the natur of fidel and relationship that it slowli but sure begin to unravel . the dialogu becom less and less engag and clever , the film tempo lose it liveli , the dynam between the charact evolv in unconvinc fashion , and sever sequenc fall flat . subtl and not-quite-subtl allus are made ( a poster of jule et jim hang promin on the wall ) , and secret are reveal which barrel the film toward an uncompel weepi final . one key turn point in the film is the kinki sex scene between blake and carla . two girl and a guy was embroil in a bitter , long-run disput with the mpaa with regard to this scene -- contractually-oblig to deliv an r-rate film , mr . toback was forc to resubmit fourteen scaled-down version of the steami interlud befor the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rate in favour of an r -- and while admit titil , the net effect of the vignett on the film themat narrat is rather dubious . if anyth , two girl and a guy serv as a showcas for the phenomen talent of mr . downey jr . , whose versatil is put to the test in this film . he play the gamut from indign to humbl , from self-assur to disconcert , yet his act gear shift so smooth as to not be regist . it a wonder perform in a role custom-tailor for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four day short after mr . downey jr . was arrest on drug charg , and it hard not to see echo of realiti seep into his charact -- in a monologu to his mirror reflect , blake self-chid to " get [his] shit togeth " is disquiet in it reson . while mr . downey jr . 's showstop perform is undoubt the primari strength of the film , both actress are solid in more broadly-observ role . ms . graham is quick becom one of america more dare actress , involv herself in three success riski project -- two girl and a guy and boogi night are both quit sexual frank , while lost in space has a screenplay pen by akiva goldsman . she quit appeal here , play a charact at onc both dainti and sultri . meanwhil , ms . gregson wagner initi portray lou with such an unwarr spunk that audienc are like to find it either annoy , or , like me , endear . she tone it down substanti as the film progress , but i found her more fun to watch as the artifici excit chatterbox . the film was report shot in eleven day , film most in sequenc , and the result artifact of this rapid shoot are evid throughout . two girl and a guy has an agil , spontan sort of feel , and one sens that mr . toback encourag a good deal of improvis from his three actor . while the film could be transpos direct to the stage more or less intact , it doesn't feel constrict ; the expans apart set is well-us to vari the background , and mr . toback allow his camera to wander and linger on his charact in an effect manner . two girl and a guy fall short of it potenti , but thank to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it still often an enjoy , bite funni romp , particular as we watch the surprisingly-resili blake evas tri to ration his behaviour and even turn the tabl on his girlfriend . " i'm an actor , " he tell them at one point , use the ol tried-and-test occupational-hazard defens . " actor lie . " but not , they all seem to agre , denzel washington .
0 the king and i , a warner brother anim , music featur , recycl the classic stori of a woman who challeng the heart of a king , with obvious result . when anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteach , travel to saim to educ the king ( martin vidnov ) children , she learn that the king is treat his peopl unfair , and must say someth to the greedi ruler . meanwhil , the king prime minist ( ian richardson ) , the stereotyp villain , plot to overthrow the king , take the throne . the last , and most predict , main subplot deal with the king son ( allen d . hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arab ) , and how he conflict with his feel , and the ancient law of saim . not even the lone strong charact of anna can save the unbeliev horribl wast of talent , as the king and i problem could fill the blank page of a journal . i will onli note the major difficulti , for it would take page to elabor on everi detail . the screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqelin feather , and david seidler , which is base upon the play written by richard rodger and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogu written in a film within recent memori , as everi time the obnoxi king would shout , " etc , etc , etc , " i would cring . liter . speak of cringing- i did quit a bit of this dure the rather short film , which is a classic display of terribl filmmak . besid the repetit dialogu from the king , on the whole , the song seem out of place , and unlik the lyric , are unmag . the sole song which is use clever is " get to know you , " which is use as anna show the children the great outdoor , which they have never been expos to . unlik disney anim featur , the king and i song don't add to the film , and are as uneffect as could be . take the follow scenario as an exampl , as the sheer horror of the king and i music is at it worst . you'r be hunt by a dragon ! what do you do ! ? sing a happi song ! martin vidnov voic the king without effort or emotion- you hear the say two negat don't make a posit ? believ it ! with the terribl dialogu that the king has , along with his aw voic track , the king is complet unbeliev , onli show mild sign of ani person , and the onli thing that chang in the king is that he say " etc . , etc . , etc . , " more and more as the film progress . no person at the begin of the movi , none at the end . and where doe this charact person chang ? hey , i thought anna was suppos to chang him ! isn't that the whole plot ? the prime minist hideous sidekick ( darrel hammond ) bring his share of cring as well - oh no ! anoth one of his teeth fell out ! hardy-har-har ! he is suppos to bring laugh for the kidlet , but even at age five i would have cring while watch him . by the way this review is go , you may think the reason for my hate for this film is due to not like anim films- henc whi i hate this movi , becaus the king and i is a disgrac to anim . anim film , such as 1994 the lion king and 1998 the princ of egypt , are among my favorit movi of all time . the anim team doe design their share of well anim set , so this make it easier to take my mind off of the annoy king , until i realiz that day and night switch back in fourth within second . i have not read the play , or seen the oscar win , 1956 film adapt , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version complet butcher the play , for the king and i is never magic , nor interest . if it wasn't for miranda richardson , who voic anna with feel , the king and i could earn the titl , " worst movi of the decad . " instead , the king and i will just go down as among the year worst . the bottom line- avoid this movi at all cost . not even young children , the target audienc in this film , will enjoy it . not the slightest bit .
0 i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadow with the highest of hope . the origin film , releas last summer , was genuin scari and terrifi ; i hope that this movi would live up to it predecessor . unfortun , my hope were soon dash . as the movi open , the audienc is shown pseudo-documentari clip of burkittsvill , maryland resid be interview about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the origin blair witch project movi . it a most humor , self-awar poke at the media hype and hysteria surround the first film . dure this segment , we are introduc to the protagonist , a young man who sell blair witch-rel memorabilia from his websit . the movi then cut to a titl that inform us that what we are about to see occur one year previous . we see the same young man that was sell blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confin in a mental institut the sort of which one onli find in bad horror movi . we see him have some sort of disgust white goo unconvinc forc down his nose while a cigarette-smok doctor lurid leer abov him . we see him throw himself wild around a pad room ; we see him cower nake in a shower stall as a fire hose is turn on him . no explan is provid for whi he is in the mental institut ; in fact , these scene are bare refer to again . i had a sink feel dure these open scene ; general , a hospit scene that is set with poor light , filthi interior , and evil doctor is a sure sign that you are in the throe of a truli horribl movi . the movi cut again , this time to the present . the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( play by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movi , the charact name are ident to the actor name , although this movi admit up front that it is fiction , so there no reason for the practic this time around ) , is round up a group of peopl that he will be lead into the wood that weekend for the " blair witch hunt , " which is a promot gimmick he came up with and sell on his websit . we meet tristen and steven , a young coupl who are write a book about the blair witch experi . steven is a skeptic , believ the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria . tristen , on the other hand , believ that there may be some truth to the rumor of supernatur occurr . she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complain that the radio is play too loud . ( she also complain that she feel nauseat ; i knew immedi that the charact was pregnant , and my intuit was confirm a few scene later when kim psychomag suss it out . how did i know ? becaus in bad movi , nauseat women are alway pregnant . ) the fourth member of their parti is erica , a wiccan with flow hair and wide eye who want to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemeteri . kim is dress complet in black , has extrem goth-styl makeup on , and occasion display seem psychic abil , but otherwis seem to be the most intellig and reason person out of the entir bunch . presum she want to be pick up in the cemeteri just for dramat effect ; it never explain . the parti of five head off into the wood as promis . they reach the crumbl ruin of the foundat of rustin parr hous and set up camp , complet with extens video equip with which to record the night event . there is a brief encount with a rival blair witch tour group who had plan to camp at that site as well , but after a few word are exchang , the rival group huff off and make camp elsewher . the movi veer off at this point to spend mani long , long minut show the drink parti that ensu after the sun goe down . sexual innuendo are toss around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consum , and noth much els happen . this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessari . the next day , the team wake up and discov that their camera equip has been complet trash , and that steven and tristen manuscript paper is flutter down from the sky in shred , like snow . the videotap are miss , but thank to a psychic intuit from kim , they discov the videotap buri underneath the foundat of the hous , " right where the origin blair witch tape were found ! " ooh . spooki . the team goe back to jeffrey hous -- a creepi old civil war-era warehous in the heart of the wood -- to regroup and review the tape . they soon discov that the tape mysteri skip five hour of the night . wacki hijink ensu . tristen start have weird dream in which she is the blair witch , everybodi start find these weird rune-lik burn mark on their bodi , steven and erica have some high disturb mutual hallucin , and everyth pretti much goe to hell in a handbasket . throughout the entir ordeal , jeffrey and the other continu to scrutin the videotap , which seem to have some kind of weird imag on them at about the point that the time jump ; eventu tristen wander in , mutter someth about " revers , " and from this they somehow realiz that they have to play the tape backward . when they do this , they discov what realli happen dure the five lost hour . ( one of the thing they see on the videotap is footag of themselv buri the videotap . okay , if the videotap were be buri , then how were they record themselv . . . oh , nevermind . ) this movi was aw . simpli aw . the charact are broadly-drawn caricatur that are never allow ani depth or develop . erica is the nature-lov wiccan . tristen is the weak and sympathet woman . steven is the overbear asshol . kim is the antisoci goth girl . old , tire clich were use to illustr these caricatur . how do we know tristen is weak and sympathet ? becaus she pregnant ! how do we know kim is an antisoci goth girl ? becaus she wear a lot of eye makeup ! how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? becaus he has jag teeth and talk like he straight out of " deliver " ! this is weak storytel at it worst . rather than take the time to flesh out the charact and make them truli sympathet , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotyp characterist , in an attempt to use some cinemat shorthand and therebi skip straight to the action . it didn't work . on top of be poor develop , most of the charact were either serious unlik or patent stupid . ( " honey , you just had a miscarriag out in the wood and got medic attent at a hospit that look like it belong in a bad slasher movi . let get on a plane home . " " no . i am have these bizarr nightmar and see strang vision and i want to find out what go on . " " ok . " ) frank , by the end of the movi , i was root for the witch . i also felt that there was simpli too much blood n gore in this film . the first movi work by never show us the horror . the witch was a palpabl presenc in that movi , but we never saw it ; we never saw anyth , in fact . the horror was all off-screen , and thus our imagin work overtim to envis what it might possibl be . this is the hallmark of a truli creepi and disturb horror movi . blair witch 2 dispens with such niceti and went straight for the gross-out . this was evid from the open scene of the mad doctor forc white goo down jeffrey throat , and continu throughout the film as the audienc is treat to occasion confus and disori footag of what appear to be a ritual massacr of some sort . knive plung into flesh , bloodi finger trail off into the dark , and none of it is explain until the veri end , when it was too late for me to care . this movi didn't stop with show us the gore , either ; it went for broke and show us everyth . by the end of the movi , there are no question remain about the miss five hour . it is all explain ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in love detail . i confess to be someon who prefer horror movi in which you never see the monster , or see onli brief glimps , mere suggest of what the monster is ; it is not becaus i find the monster so terrifi , but becaus i find the absenc of the monster to be infinit more terrifi . i have seen interview with the director in which he suggest that there is no " monster , " that all of the evil was perpetr onli by the human mind . i found this to be a miser poor explan ; if it was in fact the director intent , then he need to have some word with the writer , becaus it was not made clear at all . ( i know a lot of peopl who like to go to parti and get drunk and stone out of their mind ; none of them has ever gone on a murder rampag and then experienc mass hallucin with a group of other peopl for the next week or so . and if there was no witch , then what about the vanish tree ? the snowfal of manuscript paper ? hm ? ) blair witch 2 : book of shadow was a horribl movi . from the poorly-written charact to the implaus stori to the plot inconsist to the gross-out shot , it was a bad effort through and through .
0 this movi is written by the man who is deem to be " one of the hottest writer in hollywood " . he wrote the groundbreak screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then ad the success i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) script to his mix , and also creat the popular tv seri " dawson creek " . so when he ask to direct his first movi , base on his first ever script written , everyon and their grandma said " sure , go for it ! " . uhhm , my question is . . . did anyon bother read this stupid script ? ? ? plot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistaken caught with some cheat paper by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs . tingl , and set to lose her scholarship to colleg . when she and her friend visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the stori , they end up tie her up , and slowli tri to talk some sens into the hardhead woman . critiqu : it not so much that this is a bad movi , than the fact that it suck . this movi is chock-ful of one-dimension charact , contain no actual humor that i was abl to zone in on , zero tension or thrill , plot hole the size of my big ass , lame pop tune play to mask noth go on in the movi , and molli ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley ann warren toss away in throwaway role . i was prime for this film as it interest premis had me think miseri ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortun for williamson , he went nowher with the bright foundat , make refer to the exorcist and dr . zhivago , which i doubt mani in his target market will appreci . he also forgot about suspens , with all of his charact base on incomprehens decis , unbeliev motiv and simpli bore us with all of their trite dialogu . sure , kati holm is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reason amus impress of the exorcist ( worth two point out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgiv the biggest one-dimension charact in ani film , holm rival in the film , mrs . tingl complet unprofession be let go by all other around her ( are teacher allow to behav that way nowaday ? ) and a transpar romanc between holm and some long-hair dude , hire to be the poor man version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man version of johnni depp ! ) . all in all , this movi was laughabl for me , provid me with no insight into anyth , demonstr williamson genuin lack of directori skill alongsid a juvenil script , and provid helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortun forget to give her charact ani believ , human or capac to comprehend . no hip line , no cheap thrill , just a dull time at the movi theater . if you want to see a funni teenag movi , go see detroit rock citi ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorri ass in the morn . littl known fact about this film and it star : kevin williamson father was a fisherman . kevin use his knowledg of fish hook and winch when creat the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) . he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincident , so is dawson leeri on tv " dawson creek " , a show kevin creat . he was onc an aspir actor . in fact , he even land a bit part on tv " anoth world " . also , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupport english teacher who onc told him that he would never amount to anyth was the inspir for mrs . tingl , which is also loos base on the book " kill mr . griffin " by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) , loi duncan . he has also come out and said that he is a gay man . helen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff . she is marri to director taylor hackford , whose work includ devil advoc ( 8/10 ) and an offic and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) . this film was origin titl kill mrs . tingl , but was chang after the columbin high school shoot incid . actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project call " wasteland " . this is actor barri watson first full featur film . he has play the charact of " seth " on tv " malibu shore " sever time .
1 label is sometim everyth . in origin mad max , the open titl set the plot of the movi in near futur , thus make it one of the scienc fiction classic , despit the futur world be almost exact like our own . walter hill want the same open titl for his action classic the warrior . produc weren't thrill by that idea and consequ the movi lost all of it futurist overton . on the other hand , produc were right on the mark ; walter hill was accus of actual promot some disturb trend that were quit visibl in contemporari america . to make the movi even more distant from futur , plot was loos base on anabasi , histor book written by xenophon , greek mercenari soldier who had describ his adventur in ancient persia 2400 year ago . instead of ancient persia , movi begin in contemporari coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warrior , local youth gang , get invit to the great gather of all youth gang from the citi . the gather , organis by gramerci park riff , most power gang in the citi , is take place in bronx . that is far away from warrior home territori , but small and unarm deleg of the warrior get there safe thank to the general truce . on the gather , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismat leader of the riff , announc his grand plan to unit all the gang and take over the citi . crowd is enthusiast , but the small gang of rogu , led by psychopath luther ( david patrick kelli ) use the opportun to assassin cyrus . polic simultan raid the gather , and in the commot warrior get blame by the kill , and their leader get kill by riff . the remain eight , led by cleon lieuten swann ( michael beck ) , must now tri to get to coney island , but this time unprotect by truce and instead be chase by all the gang . upon it releas , despit the controversi and even some youth riot that were alleg inspir by it , the warrior enjoy immens popular and veri quick receiv some kind of a cult status . howev , despit be one of the best movi of that year , and be direct by talent action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movi fail to leav as strong impress to the futur generat as some other cinemat achiev of that same year . the reason for that probabl lie in a fact that this movi age veri quick . if walter hill idea was to warn the public about problem of urban america , he fail miser . the futur was much wors than his vision . the youth gang , as present in the warrior , are far from shadowi armi , abl to take over entir citi . their member seem more interest in unorthodox fashion and their littl petti feud than such prosaic , and for the public more annoy , matter like crime . in their vocabulari , word " arm " is reserv for small knive and blunt object , and onli few of them use heavi artilleri like handgun . they even have their own , veri strict and detail law , upheld more strict than some govern do with their own . mani peopl in american citi would be more than happi to see their young crimin behav like those in the warrior . some of the critic who accus hill of actual prais youth crime had a lot argument in their favour . despit those object , the warrior have all the element of a veri good film . the plot is simpl , and serv as good basi for numer action scene . the fight are brilliant choreograph and quit realist , although there isn't much bloodsh or gore in the movi . edit is superb , event happen at quick pace , with the except of middl , when bore moralist exchang between swann and his would-be-girlfriend merci ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territori . the soundtrack by barri de vorzon is veri suggest and recognis . yet , the trademark of this film are the actor who show great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonym . best known of them is david patrick kelli , whose superb and origin perform in this film later subscrib him to the role of psychopath villain . michael beck as cool , almost statesman-lik leader of a gang , is also veri good , and jame remar give good contrast as his hot-shot contend for top spot . all in all , this movi is perhap date , yet in it hour and half can give a lot more entertain than most of the contemporari movi .

" who are these jedi knight ? " i ask . " whi are they churn out stale dialogu with machine-gun rapid ? " " whi aren't these charact be develop befor their adventur ? " " whi is there a special effect shot in near everi frame of the entir film ? " these were just some of my question earli on . later , i ask , " where the magic of the first three film ? " and " whi am i look at my watch everi fifteen minut ? ' by the end of the film , i was tire , madden , and depress . georg luca has funnel his own wonder movi into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbust . the phantom menac is no star war film . take away the titl and the jedi talk and the forc , and you'r left with what is easili one of the most vacuous special effect movi of all time . it an embarrass . i look desper for a scene in which a charact is explor , or a new theme is examin , or a special effect shot isn't use . there are a few of each , but they'r all token attempt . the fact is , georg luca has creat what is simultan an abysm bad excus for a movi and a pretti good showcas for digit effect . this is not what i want to see . i didn't want to leav the phantom menac with a headach and a bitter tast in my mouth , but i did . the stori center most around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , look lost and confus ) and his apprentic , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarc has a line in the film ) and their attempt to liber the peopl of the planet naboo . naboo is the victim of a bureaucrat war with the trade feder ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natali portman ) , the teenag ruler who truli care for her peopl . after pick up jar jar bink ( a complet cgi charact , voic by ahm best ) , they head to tatooin , where they meet young anakin skywalk ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . qui-gon know that the forc is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knight take the boy with them on their journey . the bad guy are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough line to regist as charact . there isn't anyth particular wrong with this stori when look at it in synopsi form . the way luca has handl it , howev , it unsatisfactori . first of all , we don't learn one singl thing about qui-gon jinn . not one thing . what was his life like befor this film ? well , i imagin he didn't have one . that whi he feel like a plot devic . this probabl explain whi neeson look so hopeless in the role , and whi he recent retir from film ( i don't blame him , honest ) . obi-wan , a charact i was realli look forward to learn more about , is even less interest . mcgregor has just a few line , so anyon hope to see the engag young actor in a great perform is urg to look elsewher . sinc these two men are the focus of the phantom menac , luca has serv us a big emot void as the centerpiec of his movi . thing start to pick up when our charact reach tatooin ; young anakin is perhap the onli truli fleshed-out charact in the film , and lloyd doe a thought job with the role . i was also huge impress with the sand speeder scene ; rare is an action sequenc so fast and so excit . and when anakin say goodby to his mother , i found it move . also fair good is portman , and she manag to give a littl depth to a charact where no depth has been written . jar jar bink is one of the most annoy charact i'v ever had to endur , but he more interest than most of the human . as soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooin is over , it back to the mind-numb special effect and depthless action scene . i'v seen mani movi that qualifi as " special effect extravaganza , " but the phantom menac is the first one i'v seen that had me sick of the special effect fifteen minut into the movi . the reason is obvious : georg luca has no restraint . i can't say that i didn't find the effect origin , becaus i did -- the final battl between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visual except , as is most of the film . but i also found the effect deaden and tiresom . my break point was near the end of the pictur , as anakin is get question by yoda and the other jedi master ; in the background , we see hundr of digit spaceship fli around through a digit sky , and i want that to go away . can't we have one stink scene that isn't burst at the seem with a special effect shot ? i got so sick of look at the cgi charact and spaceship and planet and background that i realli just want to go outsid and look at a physic landscap for a few hour . and then there the question of magic . what was lost in the sixteen year between the phantom menac and return of the jedi ? i have a feel that luca was so focus on how his movi look that he forgot entir the way it should feel . john william familiar score is no help , nor is luca direct . i think it come right down to charact : there are none here . i long for the magnet presenc of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . and what about the ridicul expect ? mine weren't that high ; i simpli want a film that show me the root of the film that i grew up love , a stori that had a few charact and a few great special effect . instead , i got two hour and fifteen minut of a lifeless and imagin comput graphic show . i don't hate the phantom menac as much as i resent it : i'd like to forget that it exist , and yet i can't . it here to stay . i can onli hope that episod ii and iii have someth of substanc in them , becaus if they don't , then luca will have pull off the imposs task of destroy his own indestruct seri .

0 ary cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonian who meet in a bar , go to the movi , fall in love , move in togeth , etc . review ====== well , if you haven't seen when harri met salli or he said , she said , or if you don't watch love & war on televis , you might think this is the most invent film to come along in age . howev , if you'v seen ani of these , than you have seen most of this film . this of cours doesn't mean it bad . some of it is amus , but overal , i just had to ask what the point ? ary cross is the stereotyp singl male who fall in love . kevin pollack is the stereotyp female-fear best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar joke , most if which weren't veri funni . couteney cox is the stereotyp career-mind woman who fall in love . juli brown is the stereotyp bizarr best friend of said woman . ( notic the frequent use of the word stereotyp . this film use a lot of formula , the plot is basic known from the open credit . ) so what is good about the movi ? well as i said there are a few amus moment . surpris , juli brown , who i usual find just plain goofi , was the best thing in the film . also there are sever veri funni sequenc involv analysi of the human mate ritual . gee , this is realli short . not much to say about the film realli . it is just kind of there . watch it on video might not be a complet wast of time , but i wouldn't recommend hire a babi sitter or spend a lot of money to see it at the theatr .
1 eddi murphi has had his share of up and down dure his career . known for his notori late 80 slump , murphi has still manag to bounc back with a hand of hit in the past few year . with the except of the dread holi man , he appear to be on pace for a full-fledg comeback . life was a great move on the part of murphi and co-star martin lawrenc , becaus it a great showcas for both actor that never resort to slap-sticki drivel . director ted demm is smart enough to realiz that the two comedian can generat enough genuin laugh on their own , and doesn't insert a distract plot to back them up . life is , in a sens , one great balanc act with murphi on one end and lawrenc on the other . amaz , the scale never tip in either favor due to the marvel chemistri and wonder contrast that each actor allow the other . as the movi open , we'r introduc to ray gibson ( eddi murphi ) , a two-tim pickpocket who schmooz his way into a club . there he meet a success businessman name claud bank ( martin lawrenc ) . somehow , after multipl contriv , the mismatch pair find themselv on their way to mississippi on a moonshin run . when all is said and done , ray and claud have been frame for a murder that was actual commit by the town sheriff . henc the set of life : mississippi state prison , where the main charact come to realiz their unlik friendship is import , and becom set on find an fool-proof escap plan . the film take us from the 30 all the way to the 90 , present a difficult task in show how the age process affect ray and claud . luckili , rick baker handl the makeup effect of the two actor in a fantast , academi award calib manner . not onli do we believ the charact look as if they'r 90 year old , but they sound like it , too . murphi and lawrenc are complet convinc in the lead role , even as crotcheti old con bicker over a game of card . this is just one of the pleasant surpris that the film has tuck up it sleev . while the ad are market life as a straight arrow comedi , there is a hefti amount of dramat materi hidden at it core . but the comed aspect work wonder , wise draw strength from the talent of the two star . the movi is more of a comedi than it is a drama , but in both sens , it an overwhelm delight . i could say a few bad thing about the movi , but i don't want to . it such a nice surpris , such a great vehicl for eddi murphi and martin lawrenc , that it warrant a huge smile as the credit begin to roll .
1 i wish i could say that there is someth more to the new star war instal than what you see in the commerci , but there isn't . georg luca is an expert at craft triumphant , special effects-bound flick and he has done it again . this is the first star war film i'v seen on the big screen , so , of cours , the impact was much greater than when i watch the three origin episod on video . what is compel about the phantom menac is not it dispos stori , but it amaz visual . basic , the film plot is center around trade disput between two planet . qui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentic obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the anim jar-jar bink to fix the mess that may result in war . when their ship break down and they are strand , they find a young boy , anakin skywalk ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . qui-gon strong believ that anakin is destin for jedi great and immedi take him under his wing . anakin particip in a heart-pound podrac , one of the highlight of the film , to get the equip need to fix qui-gon ship . howev , most everyon is doubt about entrust the futur to some unknown slave boy . meanwhil , queen amadala ( natali portman ) is frustrat and at wit end , be na ? ve and young and have so much respons on her shoulder . there are hard ani emot scene in the film- even when we discov that anakin will be leav his slave mother behind to begin jedi train , the frenzi excit of the whole film wear down the poignanc to the size of a crumb . this doe not prove that the phantom menac is poor made for it is brilliant made . in all the star war film , human emot that we , the audienc , can identifi with are usual nil , but the film are for pure enjoy , not for uplift purpos . despit the fun of watch the movi , the phantom menac is not without flaw . for starter , we have the ill-conceiv , moron charact jar-jar bink who should be consid a threat to star war galact societi and to the audienc . what a klutz ! georg luca clumsili tri to creat a fun charact that would be as memor as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , ala , his effort were in vain . second ( this may be good or bad , depend on your point of view ) , the movi atmospher is so differ from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star war instal . this is due , perhap , to the utter complex to this movi plot and the higher level of sophist of the visual effect use here . the movi seem to be reach for epic proport . i can't say much about the act , though act has never been what you saw star war movi for anyway . howev , there is absolut no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at time , stale . natali portman has a great presenc , but her turn as queen amadala make the queen a stoic , unfeel ? enigma . there is noth we can hold onto in her perform to make us believ the trade predica is anyth of import . jake lloyd is the onli actor here who has an ounc of evid spunk . despit the inevit fault , there is so much to enjoy about the movi . the heighten excit of the final sequenc doesn't quit surpass the famous the empir strike back climact scene , but they are amaz and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . the film is a treasur to look at . the visual effect are astonish 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspir , mouth-open , eye-pop sight of the underwat citi is noth short of product design and special effect genius . not sinc 1997 the fifth element has there been a film as drench in visual treat as this one . the product design is reminisc of the fifth element , the previous star war movi , kubrick 2001 , mayb even of fritz lang classic silent metropoli . howev , all the set are so origin . the origin star war movi can't even match the grandeur of this film visual and that is a sheer pleasur for the viewer- it give us hope of even greater thing for the upcom episod . the costum are remark and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . whether it queen amadala gigant wardrob complet with gold-embroideri and feather , or the jedi simpl brown uniform , the costum design has fuse talent with outrag . the costum are one of the true delight of watch the movi . as for john william score , i don't think he done one as complex or power sinc ? i can't even rememb . it is as epic as his schindler list score and as thrill and zest as jaw . it includ the bare bone of his music from the previous three film , but william has ad on , made the music much more intens and move . what with the overwhelm hoopla that circl this movi , one might come in with high expect and be disappoint . there is veri littl to hate in the film : it a veri accomplish and skill made flick . it is the best " fun " film and the best big-budget film out today , most definit .
0 if anyth , " stigmata " should be taken as a warn against releas similarly-them film relat close to one anoth . of the four supernatur horror flick releas this year , it is clear the worst . i suppos i should have seen this come . after all , " blair witch " thorough creep me out , " sixth sens " was mild spooki , and then " stir of echo " had it moment , but wasn't anyth i'd lose sleep over . clear , the qualiti of the horror this summer has slowli been drop . is it then ani surpris that " stigmata " is the dullest , most horribl execut piec of mtv-influenc tripe i have seen in a long while ? no , not realli . patricia arquett play franki page , a hairdress from pittsburgh who receiv a rosari as a gift from her globe-trot mother . as it turn out , the rosari belong to a recently-deceas brazilian priest . the priest church had been under investig by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrn ) becaus of the mysteri appear of a bleed statu . father kiernan is an investig who has made a career out of disprov suppos religi sign , but this time he believ there is someth to the bleed statu . his investig is soon call off , howev , when the franki start exhibit sign of the stigmata , in which a person is inflict with wound like that of jesus christ . father kiernan is initi skeptic of franki s stori , consid she an atheist , but onc he wit the stigmata attack himself , he dedic himself to find out what is go on . he eventu begin to suspect that his boss , cardin houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is conceal someth that could bring down the cathol church . as it turn out , the dead priest had been work on the translat of a " fifth gospel " befor they were excommun . the new rupert wainwright music video . . . i mean film " stigmata " is the sort of film that start off ok and onli get wors . inde , it would have been good if it were a music video , becaus it onli interest for about five minut . i'm not sure what wainwright is tri to prove with his endless parad of slow-mot , double-exposur , and extrem close-up ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swell head of ani director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . his camera trickeri is interest for a littl while , but eventu , it becom headache-induc . what this film need is a second audio track to be play over the dialogu ( such as it is ) , with wainwright scream at the audienc , " see ? look at what i can do ! i'm an ex-cel dir-ect-or . " mayb then he'd explain whi he decid to start half of his scene with slow-mot shot of water drip in revers , or whi he includ random superflu shot as that of an egg fri ( ooh , scari ! ) . if there was some under mean behind all this camera trickeri , i didn't see it . just when you thought it was safe to get involv in the stori , here come a double-exposur shot of two patricia arquett collaps into bed for no reason whatsoev . arrrrrrrghhhh . . . then again , the superflu camera trickeri wouldn't bother me if " stigmata " had a stori or charact that were remot engag . though wainwright vaniti certain doesn't help , he doe seem to have been given a near unwork script . where are plot continu and charact develop when you need them ? case in point : franki page is the charact that ( i assum ) we are suppos to identifi and sympath with , but we aren't given ani back stori on her charact , or ani reason to like her . the extent of her charact develop seem to be that she is a hard-work hairdress ( who can somehow afford a cavern apart on the top floor of her build ) and she kind of cute , so let start the bleed ! the fact that she clear not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either . accord to franki page , what is the first thing to do after receiv mysteri wound on your wrist and back ? go club ! sure , that make sens . arquett , byrn , and pryce give it the old colleg tri , but their charact are so one-dimension that they just appear to be sleepwalk . scene between arquett and byrn that were probabl suppos to be sexual charg fall almost embarrass flat , becaus the setup of the romant subplot is so clumsili handl that it almost reach the point of becom laughabl . even though franki page life is fall apart befor her veri eye , she still find the time to hit on a priest who wander in to her hair salon . even more curious , he seem to be interest in her advanc . father andrew religi doubt pop up so sudden that it seem more silli than dramat . as for pryce , he may as well wear a curl mustach and cackl , " i'll get you , my pretti , " for all the depth his cardin houseman is afford . trust me , i'm not reveal anyth by tell you pryce turn out to be a villain . what wors , after be face with dull charact and the prospect of have annoy camera trick and loud music jam down our throat , we now have to contend with a stori that start off in one direct , veer off in anoth , then anoth , and end up be total incomprehens . first of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be veri simpl plot detail . how doe franki get the stigmata mere by touch a rosari ? how come an atheist like her was chosen , sinc father andrew mention that onli veri devout believ have ever receiv stigmata ? actual , i'm not sure what franki was posess by . suppos , stigmata occur when one is posess by the holi spirit , but the film later has her be posess by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . which one is it ? the answer to this question , of cours , is veri simpl : the possess entiti in each scene is determin by whichev effect and flashi camera work mr . wainwright want to use this time . furthermor , the end is a ridicul neat littl wrap-up , and the filmmak compound this problem by ultim turn the film into a diatrib against the cathol church . if you do ani research at all about the gospel of st . thoma , you'll find that it is not be suppress by the church ( as the film seem to claim ) , but that it is readili avail at your local librari . there noth the cathol need to worri about , though . " stigmata " religion is so off-bas that it can't be confus for anyth remot resembl the real cathol church . if they want to portray cathol priest as mobster , they should have gone all-out and equip them with sharkskin suit and tommi gun , which would have been far more interest . i'm not cathol ; in fact , i don 't care much for the cathol church , but it cartoonish misrepresent in this film should not be consid realist by ani mean . it rare to see a film that fail on as mani level as " stigmata " doe . it s not thought-provok , though it would like to be , and it is definit not scari , though it pretend to be . i'm not sure whi they tri to pass this off as a horror film , becaus there is absolut noth scari about the stori . mayb it an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scene have ani dramat weight whatsoev . the initi shock of see arquett cover with blood is dull by the fact that it happen over , and over , and over . like so mani film of the mtv generat , this one suffer from overkil . so much is overdon in " stigmata , " that it eventu has no effect on the audienc , leav us to pick out the film ( mani ) flaw . i'm also still tri to figur out whi the quotat they take from the gospel of st . thoma is so earth-shatt . when we final hear it , the say sound like someth everi five-year-old learn on their first day of sunday school , which mean that for all it flash , the whole film is realli much ado about noth . the dog day of summer usual produc one monstrous dog , and " stigmata " is it .

0 capsul : combin one quart of raider of the lost ark , a dash of a jacki chan movi ( san jacki ) , two teaspoon of gun- and swordplay , and a dollop of cgi . simmer for 100 minut . yield : zilch . the phantom is a depress and tire retread of so mani earlier , better movi that after the fifteen-minut mark i start catalogu them out loud . it hard to make a good action-adventur movi that doesn't simpli recycl it predecessor , and i'v seen movi that even at least did the recycl grace . the phantom , alleg base on the long-run comic of the same name , doesn't even bother to be grace . it a stupid and incompet movi in too mani way to list , but i'll tri . the film open up with a " prelud " sequenc that look like it was slash to ribbon in the edit and then given a heavi voice-ov to compens for whatev got thrown out . we go from there to a jungl sequenc that , i swear to god , recycl the truck-chas scene from raider of the lost ark note-for-not , possibl even shot-for-shot , right down to the moment where indi wrench open the door and slung one of the driver out into the brush -- and then goe on to rip off the rope-bridg scene from " sorcer " as well ! sorcer , as you may well rememb , was a remak of a french movi , the wage of fear , in which a bunch of lowlif were paid pile of money to drive a truck load with nitro through horribl jungl terrain . both version of that movi were far more interest than this flick , but i'v got my job to do , so back to the salt mine we go . anyway , the cinemat theft doesn't stop there . or at least the lack of inspir . there isn't a singl thing here we haven't seen , and it not given to us in a way that remot evok our interest . we have ( where my list ? ) a bad girl , a tough good girl , a secret cave hideaway ( which seem inspir more by dr . no than anyth els ) , a boardroom meet that drip with greed and venal , magic artifact of terribl power , and cary-hiroyuki tagawa wast in anoth stupid role where he get to wear a fu manchu mustach and sneer a lot and general humili himself . what els is there ? the plot is a wast of time . the set altern between big but hokey -- and tini and still hokey . there are line in the script that are just beg to be mst3ked -- and i'm sure onc mike and the bot get the cash , they'll stick it on their sked . the onli thing in the movi worth note is billi zane -- he a good actor , and he tri veri hard , even when the script is send him down one dead alley of a scene after anoth . all i can say is that i pray this isn't the begin of the end for him -- although it sure look like the final nail in the coffin for the comic-book super-hero movi .
0 for those interest in the true spirit of moviemak - or what left of it in mainstream hollywood - movi which are star vehicl are terribl thing . as a rule , the ignor general principl of cinema becaus they are not made to advanc the media but rather to advanc the career of a particular actor . an actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposur ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck . general , though , the actor doesn't matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleagu warner brother , exemplifi this : the pictur lack pizazz . the star for the vehicl in this case is kurt russel , otherwis known as the man of thirti word or less . russel play todd , a human train from birth in the way of wage war and becom emot distanc from the carnag he has wrought . the movi let us see this degener process , but by the time the real plot start , we'r into todd later year . he about to be replac by a new breed of soldier , one who , instead of be train * from * birth , are genet select * befor * birth . the pride of this class - cain 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he the villain becaus he has a stare contest with our hero near the movi start . between the two lead , less than a full type page of dialogu is spoken , and it possibl to imagin a script which is nineti percent stage direct . director paul anderson , who helm last year ici thriller , event horizon , doesn't show ani invent here and instead is content to let the action play out on screen ad nauseam . todd , upon be replac , is left to die on a garbag planet ; but in order to stretch the run time out , the villain return to the garbag planet on a " routin patrol " and set the stage for the final firefight . event are predict from the time that the setup are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwrit david peopl attempt to show ani creativ here . the most annoy plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movi come to be : todd fail to show physic superior against cain - in fact , not even todd and two of his companion can best the baddi - but near the end of the movi he show remark prowess with automat weaponri . it not as though todd undergo ani signific charact chang throughout the plot of the stori , and so the plot has a veri can feel about it . the best rout through this disast is to take it lightheart in spirit , and treat it as a parodi of typic action fare , like univers soldier . a strict interpret , howev , reveal an unmistak and unforgiv lack of style , class , or substanc ; and by next year , a larg percentag of the peopl who have seen this will have tape it off of network televis .
1 i must admit that i was a tad skeptic of " good will hunt " , base both on the preview and the first fifteen minut of the film , in which the main charact will hunt ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his earli twenti , is discov to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solv two extraordinarili difficult math problem overnight . the onli problem is that will is a tough street kid who had his share of run-in with the law , and befor long he be haul in for assault after a park lot fight . professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problem in his lectur , track him down and strike a deal with the polic : will is to be releas , provid he work with lambeau on his math research regular and attend therapi session . this sound like the formula for mild charm fluff , but " good will hunt " rise abov it fair mundan premis to deliv a poignant and clever drama . a conflict gradual emerg between lambeau and will therapist sean mcguir ( robin william ) - lambeau want to get will to use his brain , while sean want him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been larg neglect . will find that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he get bore with it and grow increas resist to lambeau attempt to recruit him into the academ lifestyl . he also has his share of problem with his girlfriend skylar ( minni driver ) , an mit student who is move to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluct will to come with her . what make " good will hunt " work so well , asid from the strong perform ( especi from damon and william ) , is the depth of character and the represent of the conflict in will life . the script sympathi seem to lie more with sean mcguir than with lambeau , but neither of them is present as complet right or wrong . lambeau , while he may seem a littl cold at time , is still written well enough that we like him as a charact even when we'r not sure if we like what he has to say . and sean , for all his warm-hearted , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not live up to his full intellectu potenti either ; the therapi session turn out to be just as revelatori for sean as they do for will . will reaction to this situat , and the way in which he slowli becom more recept to skylar and to sean , is present in a believ fashion and in a way that forc the audienc to consid all the charact opinion , rather than set up an obvious " right " and " wrong " side and beat them over the head with it . for a film with such an extraordinari charact , " good will hunt " present itself as remark ordinari ; it achiev the difficult task of make the next albert einstein into an everyman , a charact to whom the audienc can easili relat and who must make choic similar to those that almost everyon face at one time or anoth . this film give us real drama when it so easili could have given us mere melodrama , by have the govern kidnap will to use him in covert spi mission or introduc some other equal far-fetch situat . " good will hunt " also has it share of fun humor , such as when will , in an earli therapi session , pretend to be hypnot and smooth parodi the alien abduct scenario that have becom so well known in popular cultur . and in the one scene in which govern agent do in fact appear , will blow them off with a hilari scath accus of human right violat in africa . will relationship with his friend , most notabl chucki ( ben affleck ) , is usual rather amus , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ use of the f word , which was most like the reason for it r-rate ) , and lend itself well to the develop of will charact . add all this to the fact that " good will hunt " even manag to pull off an uplift happi end without get excess sentiment , and you might be wonder whi i haven't given this film four star . well , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the stori is still rather contriv and not particular origin . there are also a few scene that did feel a bit formula , includ one that was suppos to be emot but realli just seem like the obligatori cri scene for ani movi involv therapi session . still , " good will hunt " take it premis a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definit one of the better person drama i have seen in the last few year , and as of right now it stand as one of the top five on my list of 97 film .
